As Bishop of Chelmsford, Mr Cottrell let priest David Tudor remain in post in the diocese despite knowing he had been barred by the Church from being alone with children and had paid compensation to a sexual abuse victim, a BBC investigation reveals. A spokesperson for Mr Cottrell said he had been in an \"invidious situation\" and did not have the legal power to sack the priest. Tudor was only banned from ministry two months ago - after he admitted historical sex abuse allegations relating to two girls. However, the Bishop of Newcastle the Rt Rev Helen-Ann Hartley says Mr Cottrell could have done more and should resign as archbishop. \"It completely undermines his credibility that this case was not acted on,\" she told BBC File on 4 Investigates. \"How can you have the moral and ethical authority to lead an institution with that?\" A woman who was paid £10,000 compensation by Tudor over claims he sexually abused her as a child says Mr Cottrell's failure to act when he was told about the payment means he should \"leave the Church\". \"I feel like he [Stephen Cottrell] has spat in my face,\" says Jessica (not her real name). The calls for Archbishop Cottrell to resign come at a time of turmoil in the Church of England following a damning report into how it covered up prolific abuse by the barrister John Smyth. The report led to the resignation of the Church's most senior figure, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby. Mr Cottrell will take over his role temporarily for a few months in the New Year. The BBC can reveal that Mr Welby and a former Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, were also involved in the Tudor case - Mr Welby in 2018 and Lord Carey in 1993. David Tudor did not respond to the BBC's questions. At least seven women say they were abused by Tudor. One received six-figure compensation from the Church in 2019 and others are bringing civil claims. Tudor worked for the Church of England for over 46 years, in London, Surrey and Essex, rising from curate to honorary canon. He gained a reputation for filling churches with his charismatic preaching. He was an area dean on Canvey Island in Essex in 2010, when Stephen Cottrell became Bishop of Chelmsford - a position Mr Cottrell held for 10 years before becoming Archbishop of York. During his first week in office, Mr Cottrell was fully briefed on the \"longstanding safeguarding concerns\" raised about Tudor, a spokesperson for the Archbishop said. Mr Cottrell would have been told: Mr Cottrell's office told the BBC that for much of his time as Bishop of Chelmsford he had been unable to take any disciplinary action because there were no complaints that hadn't already been dealt with. It was not until 2019, when a fresh complaint was made against Tudor leading to a suspension, that there was \"an opportunity to remove the risk\", said a spokesperson. But the Bishop of Newcastle, Helen-Ann Hartley, told File on 4 Investigates that had not been an adequate response because \"any action that could have been taken\" by Mr Cottrell \"should have been vastly stronger than simply to try and manage a risk, particularly if the priest in question is already banned from working with children or entering schools\". While Mr Cottrell's office maintains there were no grounds to act until 2019, the BBC can reveal that Mr Cottrell was told in 2012 about the £10,000 payout Tudor had made to Jessica, who says she was sexually abused by him, sometimes very violently, from the age of 11 during the 1970s when Tudor was training to be a minister. She had brought the claim after police ended an investigation without pressing charges. \"Nobody would make a payment if they haven't got something to hide,\" says Jessica. Bishop Hartley says the payout was \"completely against the principles of the institution\" that Mr Cottrell is supposed to be part of and should have led to disciplinary proceedings against the priest. The personal payment made by Tudor \"admitted no liability\" - Mr Cottrell's office told the BBC - adding that the then-Bishop of Chelmsford had been guided by \"legal advice\" that no further action could be taken. To compound the hurt felt by those who say they were abused as children by Tudor, three years after making his compensation payment, Tudor became an honorary canon of Chelmsford Cathedral. Such an appointment was \"just horrendous\" says Jessica. David Tudor's elevation to honorary canon is something Stephen Cottrell \"regrets\", says his office, but it was \"not a promotion and not a personal reward\". \"It happened because of a change in Church policy during the bishop's time in office, meaning area deans were automatically made honorary canons.\" But that is \"ludicrous\" says Bishop of Newcastle Helen-Ann Hartley and \"simply not good enough\". \"You are absolutely uplifting somebody's ministry as an example and a model of good and best practice, and you're celebrating that actually by making them an honorary canon.\" Rt Rev Hartley has been a lone voice in the upper echelons of the Church of England, criticising the institution's failure to deal with abuse and to listen to victims. Last month, she became the only senior serving cleric to call for Justin Welby to step down. Now, she says, Stephen Cottrell should follow. The BBC's investigation into the David Tudor case also reveals roles played by others at the very top of the Church of England over several decades - including former Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey. Debbie (not her real name) says between the ages of 13 and 15 she was sexually abused by Tudor when he was a vicar and school chaplain in Redhill, Surrey. She was one of the three girls in his second trial in 1988. Tudor was found guilty, but the conviction was later quashed. It has had \"a huge effect\" on Debbie's life, she says, leaving her with complex post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which she says has been made worse by the Church's handling of the case since. \"It's absolutely disgusting that they supported him, that they welcomed him back into the Church,\" she says. Tudor's return to the priesthood was assisted by then-Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey. In 1993, the archbishop - now Lord Carey - agreed that Tudor could come back under supervision the following year.  This was done \"with some trepidation\", the Church of England told the BBC. Leaked documents seen by File on 4 Investigates also show that Lord Carey agreed, in 1996, to remove the priest's name from a centrally-held record of clergy who had been subject to disciplinary proceedings. Lord Carey said he does not remember David Tudor's name. The Church of England said the request was made by the then-Bishop of Southwark Roy Williamson, who died in 2019, and Lord Carey had agreed to it. \"We recognise these procedures were neither sufficient nor survivor-focussed, and that very different decisions would have been made today,\" Southwark diocese told the BBC. \"The decision not to impose a lifetime ban on David Tudor seems absolutely inexcusable in today's context and would not have been made today.\" The Tudor case also came across the desk of the current Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby in 2018, when Rev Jenny Penn wrote to his office questioning why the priest was still in post. She had been a member of a \"core group\" of Church safeguarding advisers, and national and local clergy, asked to look into Tudor because another of his alleged victims involved in the 1988 trials had issued a claim for compensation - this time from the Church, rather than Tudor personally. The woman would later win a six-figure Church payout and an apology. Archbishop Welby had recently told all clergy that it wasn't enough to say sorry about past abuse - and that they should \"take action that demonstrates clearly that we have learnt the lessons\". In her letter to him, Rev Penn said she was \"struggling with the disconnect between the words and the practice\". She received a response saying the matter had been reviewed. Rev Penn wrote again, and was again told \"the matters raised have been dealt with\".  She says she was \"fobbed off\". \"To me it was quite clear cut that this person shouldn't be in post but [Mr Welby's office] couldn't provide a satisfactory answer as to why he was.\" The Church of England told the BBC Archbishop Welby \"took seriously the correspondence from this cleric about David Tudor's permission to officiate\" and referred her concerns to the Bishop at Lambeth who was responsible for safeguarding. A reply to a third letter from Rev Penn to Mr Welby's office came from the Bishop of Lambeth's provincial safeguarding adviser and suggested matters raised had been dealt with. Rev Penn alerted the BBC to the Tudor case after reading our story about the Church paying off a Blackburn Cathedral priest assessed as a potential risk to children. \"I was shocked once more, and angry, that similar things had happened in another place. Old sins cast very long shadows,\" she says. Stephen Cottrell's spokesperson said the Archbishop of York \"completely shares and understands the hurt and frustrations that surround this case, which were frustrations and anxieties that he lived with every day he was in office\". The Church of England said the BBC File on 4 investigation \"reveals a catalogue of past safeguarding decisions, that allowed someone considered a risk in the 1980s to return to ministry in the 1990s\".  \"This should never have happened,\" it added. Among Tudor's victims, there is relief that he is no longer in a position of power after he admitted sexual misconduct at a Church tribunal in October this year and was banned for life from ministry. \"He should never have been let back into the Church in the first place,\" says Jessica. Debbie had to move away from her hometown \"to a life where nobody knew anything about my past\". Holding back tears, she says she has \"lived with shame for 40 years\". \"It felt like he was protected. It was just so wrong.\" Additional reporting by Hayley Mortimer and Kirstie Brewer","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwydgjevx70o","published_time":"2024-12-16T06:21:28.716080Z","author_name":"Steve Swann home affairs reporter & Aleem Maqbool religion editor","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/58c7/live/0da9ee40-b974-11ef-a0f2-fd81ae5962f4.png.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bde2/live/bb6d0ba0-b976-11ef-a0f2-fd81ae5962f4.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/91ee/live/216e1aa0-b979-11ef-a2ca-e99d0c9a24e3.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/33f4/live/85803240-b978-11ef-aff0-072ce821b6ab.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/90f3/live/6d462f70-bb87-11ef-aff0-072ce821b6ab.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9e3b/live/bc6c5fd0-b89d-11ef-aff0-072ce821b6ab.jpg.webp"],"source":"bbc","category":"World","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":1,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-16T16:51:28.717Z"},"description":" Mr Cottrell will take over his role temporarily for a few months in the New Year .

{"_id":{"$oid":"67600d58c3f742fb3373bb15"},"title_or":"Councils to be merged in major local government shake-up","description_or":"District councils could be abolished and more elected mayors introduced across England under new plans for a major redesign of local government.  Ministers are set to publish a paper on Monday outlining plans for mergers in areas where there are currently two tiers of local authority - smaller district and larger county councils - in a bid to streamline services. Elected metro mayors are also set to gain new powers over planning, in a bid to speed up the delivery of new housing and infrastructure. But the body representing district councils has warned the plans could spark \"turmoil\" and argued \"mega-councils\" could undermine local decision-making.  Local government in England is currently marked by a complicated patchwork of arrangements that has changed a lot in recent years. In some places, responsibility for local services is shared between county councils, which manage areas including social care and education; and district councils, which cover smaller areas and are responsible for services such as bin collections. Some areas, particularly larger towns and some cities, have \"unitary\" authorities responsible for both - while the regions surrounding big cities are increasingly covered by multi-council \"combined\" authorities with greater powers in areas such as transport policy, planning and housing. The Conservatives created 11 such areas, which have an elected \"metro\" mayor, and set a target that every part of England that wanted greater powers in some form would get a devolution deal by 2030. Despite this, around half of England's population live in an area not covered by a devolution deal. The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more housing. A paper to be published on Monday is expected to set an ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals. Streamlining local government will be presented as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, regarded by Labour as a means to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment. Elected mayors would then oversee areas representing two or more councils, and be handed more powers over things such as planning decisions and public transport. Dozens of district councils could be abolished as a result – prompting some to claim it would deprive people of genuinely localised decision-making. It would require a series of deals nationwide emulating North Yorkshire, which now has a unitary authority after eight councils were merged together last year.  This would mark a scale of reorganisation that goes beyond what Labour promised in its election manifesto, and mark arguably the biggest shake-up of local government since the 1970s. The overall timetable and route to achieving this has not been confirmed - and it is not yet clear if the government will use legal powers to force councils together, or hope to encourage them to do so through funding arrangements. Labour argues the overhaul will make local government simpler and produce savings by making the delivery of services more efficient. In a speech on Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner will vow to make devolution the \"default position of government\", and give councils the powers they need to \"drive growth and raise living standards\". The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved. Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\". She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\". A Conservative Party spokesman said Rayner's announcement is part of a plan to \"strip councils of their powers\" and to impose reorganisation from Westminster \"without local consent\". He said the party recognises more homes need to be built but says that these must be \"in the right place\". \"This new announcement will do nothing to solve that - and instead open up another front on Labour's assault on the countryside.\" The Liberal Democrats said council budgets were \"on the brink\" and without properly investing in social care more vital services would disappear.  The plans, however, have been welcomed by the County Councils Network, which says its members \"now recognise the need to embrace the benefits\" of devolution in the face of \"significant financial challenges\". Its chairman Tim Oliver said it had become clear that in many county areas, reorganisation was needed to \"unlock\" more generous funding from central government and create \"more financially sustainable\" councils. Cllr Louise Gittins, chair of the Local Government Association, said \"genuine devolution of powers and resources can play a huge role in promoting inclusive economic growth, creating jobs, and improving public services\".  She said her members were \"open to change\" but \"remain clear that local government reorganisation should be a matter for councils and local areas to decide\". Lord Houchen, the Conservative mayor of Tees Valley, welcomed the plans, including greater powers over transport and planning. However, he told the BBC they could go further by giving more control over post-16 education, to make sure local people had the right skills for jobs being created in the area.  Monday's paper is also expected to confirm plans for increased co-operation between councils in planning for transport and infrastructure projects. Upper-tier councils, including unitary authorities and current county councils, will be required to produce slimmed-down versions of the \"spatial development\" strategies used to plan for projects in big cities. Since returning to office in July, Labour has announced four devolution deals:  Greater Lincolnshire, Hull and East Yorkshire, Devon and Torbay, and Lancashire. Combined authorities, including combined county authorities in more rural areas, are more advanced in the north of England compared to the south. There has been a weaker appetite for devolution deals in swathes of the south-west and East Anglia, where minimum population requirements would also necessitate the creation of larger combined councils.

{"_id":{"$oid":"67600d58c3f742fb3373bb16"},"title_or":"Why are more parents home-educating their children?","description_or":"\"Toby was so tremendously unhappy in school,\" says his father, Daniel. \"We were standing outside the classroom door for an hour every morning and he just didn't want to go in. \"[It reached the point where] we thought 'this doesn't work.'\" Daniel says he tried everything to settle him. Toby, who is now eight, was allowed into the classroom before other children arrived and his teacher also arranged for him to hand out books, but nothing helped. So, in May 2023 his parents decided to withdraw him from school. They are not the only ones. Government statistics released on Thursday found that a growing number of parents have withdrawn their children from mainstream education in England. An estimated 111,700 children are being home-educated, based on a census taken this year - marking a 20% rise since last year. Around 23% say their reasons for home-educating are a result of lifestyle, philosophical or preferential choices, such as religious or cultural beliefs or a rejection of an exam-based education: something that has long been the case. But 13% of families now say they made this decision because of school dissatisfaction, including a lack of support for special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) and school bullying.  In addition, 14% say it is due to their child's mental health. This is the first time the data has become mandatory, which the Department for Education says may account in part for the increase. Wendy Charles-Warner, chair of home education charity Education Otherwise, says that she is shocked by the increase in the numbers. \"It's not from parents who are wanting to home-educate,\" she argues, \"but because the school was not meeting their child's needs, and those parents should not be home-educating, because they don't want to be. Home education is not easy.\" Daniel says that this was the case for Toby. \"We had no alternative… the system is broken and does not cater for a lot of children.\" Toby has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), he explains, and requires a very flexible schedule, allowing him to spend a few minutes or a few hours on an activity, or learn \"on the move\" so he is not confined to sitting at a desk. Two of Daniel's older children, who are both autistic, are doing well at a special school but he says that Toby's educational needs aren't severe enough to qualify him for a place. \"I don't claim to be a great teacher,\" he continues. \"But I've got enough creativity and inquisitiveness to find learning opportunities as we go.\" They start the day with 20 minutes of reading. On the day we meet, they're looking at a storybook full of illustrations. Their week so far has also included gymnastics, ice-skating and forest walks.  As Daniel explains all of this, Toby is busy figuring out a puzzle in a maths workshop in a meeting room near their south London home with a group of other home-educated children. Covid lockdowns gave families a glimpse into the world of home education, as video communication technology suddenly became commonplace in many schools. Digital learning businesses and online schools sprung up too. What followed was a perfect storm: as schools re-opened, some children found the transition back to the classroom difficult, resulting in an increase in persistently absent children - around double the levels seen before the pandemic.  The latest figures from the Department for Education show that nearly one in five children missed school more than 10% of the time in the autumn and spring terms of 2023/24. Earlier this month, Sir Martyn Oliver, the chief inspector of Ofsted, England's schools regulator, said that the issue of children missing school was a \"stubborn and damaging issue\", and expressed concern over \"flexi-schooling\", where parents educate their children at home for part of the week. \"Even ten years ago [many people had] quite an idealised vision of home education involving self-directed learners who go off to Cambridge,\" explains Amber Fensham-Smith, co-director of the Open University's Children's Research Centre. \"The situation is a lot more complex now.\" \"It's plugging a gap,\" she continues. \"If your child is struggling with their mental health, you can't get an NHS referral and you want to keep them safe, what do you do? That's very different to a parent who chooses it.\" The Department for Education says it knows \"far too many children with SEND aren't having their needs met\" and recently announced £740m of funding to increase the number of places for pupils within mainstream schools. More than 1.6 million children have SEND in schools in England, an increase of 101,000 from 2023. Experts say there are various reasons for this, including greater awareness. In October, the public spending watchdog warned the special educational needs system is broken and families have lost confidence in it. Which begins to explain part of the spike in home education. What remains unclear is how effective this is as a solution. In the US, a much larger proportion of the population - an estimated 6% of children - learn at home, and studies there have found that home-educated children perform as well as, or outperform, their peers in most academic tests.  However, some experts point to the fact that participants in surveys tend to be in highly educated, middle-class families with internet access, which leaves out under-represented groups. In the UK, the Education Committee called on the government in 2021 to commission research on the life chances and social outcomes of home-educated children – but three years later, the research is still limited. One challenge with measuring success in the UK is that there is no obligation for home-educated children to follow the national curriculum or sit exams. Parents simply have a duty to provide a \"suitable education\". Earlier this month, the Education Policy Institute, an independent research organisation, warned that a lack of clarity around the law and what is required, \"potentially risks some children missing out,\" and that not knowing who or where they are \"raises questions about variation in the quality and suitability of home education.\" Others argue that there should be, for example, a minimum bar required for literacy and numeracy. But Fadoua Govaerts, who taught her five children at home and has a PhD from the University of Bath that focused on home-education experiences, believes that it's right for it to have the flexibility to be \"more holistic and inclusive\". \"Outcomes could be anything from being comfortable within their own skin, finding a new talent, become an elite athlete or actor, to gaining national qualifications or becoming an entrepreneur as a teenager,\" she says. Riyad Ozpolat has never been to school. He is 12 years old now and lives in Bristol with his parents and four siblings. His mother Weronika, a speech and language therapist, works one day a week at a school and the rest of the time home-educates three of her children. \"I've been home-schooled my whole life\", explains Riyad, as he swings on an office chair, while his 18-month old sister wanders around behind him. \"The reason I don't want to go to school is because I don't know if I'll be able to cope with sitting down.\" He sees his best friends every week at Scouts and says that he doesn't feel he's missing out on anything. Ms Ozpolat says that home-educating her children gives them a chance to focus on their passions. \"There's so much wasted time at school. I think the earlier that they can focus on their interests the better because it just means they have more expertise and extra knowledge in the thing they want to do when they're older\". However, she continues: \"As the children get older, we need to pay for them to do the GCSE exams. If they're having extra tuition and you have to pay for all of the books and resources that you need to get in order to do the exam.\" Parents who choose to home-educate take on full financial responsibility - there is no specific government support for home education. Children who are home-educated are not obliged by law to sit their GCSE exams, but if they choose to, they normally have to pay an exam board fee and an exam centre fee. Prices vary widely but for example the total cost of sitting all three GCSE maths papers at one private exam centre in London, would be £225.  Then there is the question around whether a home education always prepares people well for certain workplaces. Rachael Barrow, who is now 31, was home-educated for nine years after being bullied in school, and says she loved being taught away from the traditional classroom, but when she entered the workplace she found certain challenges. During her first job, in human resources, she struggled to adjust to having a fixed routine. \"I felt as though I was losing some of my autonomy in deciding my own schedule\", she says.  She has since changed careers and is now completing a PhD at Lancaster University. As part of this she has interviewed other adults who were previously home-educated, and found they tended to avoid corporate careers or 9-5 jobs.  Some told her that \"politics in the workplace\" was a struggle. However she is positive about the experience overall: \"I don't regret being home-educated at all\", she says. \"I think it set me up quite nicely for a career in academia.\" Some critics argue that there are gaps around regulating home-education in the UK. The current rules don't require a parent to tell the council if they are home-educating their child from the start; they only stipulate that a school must tell the local authority if a child has been de-registered. \"The UK is an absolute outlier in being the least regulated in Europe,\" says Daniel Monk, professor of law at Birkbeck, University of London. The death of 10-year-old Sara Sharif, who was removed from school by her father and stepmother to be home-educated, after her teachers raised concerns with social services, has added to the debate around strengthening regulation. Dame Rachel de Souza, the Children's Commissioner for England,  said it was \"madness\" that the law currently allowed parents to take a child out of school when concerns had already been raised. The government has set out plans to introduce a requirement for families subject to a protection plan to get council permission before removing a child from school to be home-educated. Earlier this year it also announced plans to introduce a national register in England to help account for all home-educated children. This could come into force in 2025. Dame Rachel has welcomed the decision. \"If we get proper registers, and we have local authorities taking their role seriously to engage with these families, we may find we can get lots of them back to school, which is where they need to be\", she told the Education Committee in November. But Wendy Charles-Warner argues that it is \"deeply offensive\" to parents to suggest that every child is at risk unless the local authority knows where they are. \"Home education is a big ask of parents. In most cases it's a positive move for their child, because they're acting to protect their child.\" However she acknowledges: \"Parents should not be home educating in cases where they don't want to.\" Back in south London, Toby's home education is going well - his father says he is calmer and happier - but he is all too aware that the situation is different for him than for many other families. As he puts it, they have the financial stability to be able to devote this time to educating Toby as a family. \"My wife's a doctor, we've never been financially vulnerable,\" he says. \"I'm educated, and we're very, very lucky.\" Despite all of this, he says that it has been \"bloody hard\". \"All of our kids have spent time out of school, and we have been in crisis,\" he says. \"It's not always easy but we are figuring it out\".

Sir Iain - who is applying for an urgent question in the Commons on China's influence - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the alleged spy could be \"the tip of the iceberg\" of those in the UK doing the same job. The businessman, known only as H6 due to a court order protecting his identity, was banned from the UK last week by the UK's semi-secret national security court. The court heard he had formed an \"unusual degree of trust\" with the Duke of York. Former security minister Tom Tugendhat said it showed the \"the level of threat\" posed by China to the UK. Other politicians have also shown concern over the reach of the United Front Work Department, an arm of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) which H6 is believed to have been associated with. The department is tasked with conducting influence operations. \"They're trying to change the policies of the UK and other countries around the world,\" Tugendhat said.  \"They're trying to influence individuals not just in the royal family but in academia, in politics, in business and even sometimes in journalism.\"  Talking to BBC Breakfast, he said it was a way for the CCP to \"exert influence\" within the UK. Last week, Prince Andrew said in a statement that he had \"ceased all contact\" with the Chinese businessman, with all meetings having been \"through official channels\" and \"nothing of a sensitive nature ever discussed\". H6 was invited to the prince's birthday party in 2020 and was told he could act on his behalf when dealing with potential investors in China.  In a letter found on one of H6's confiscated devices, the Chinese businessman was told by one of Prince Andrew's advisors: \"Under your guidance, we found a way to get the relevant people unnoticed in and out of the house in Windsor.\" It is not clear how H6 became close to Prince Andrew.  The alleged targeting by an alleged Chinese influence operation was the latest controversy for Prince Andrew, who is no longer a working royal. It followed scrutiny of Prince Andrew's finances this autumn, when King Charles withdrew his financial support for Prince Andrew and the costs of running Royal Lodge in Windsor, with a security bill costing several million pounds per year. Following this latest controversy there have been reports that Prince Andrew is being encouraged to keep a low profile over the Christmas season. He would usually be part of the Royal Family's Christmas Day appearance at church in Sandringham and at another Christmas Royal gathering this week and there have been suggestions he will be advised to keep out of public sight and not attract any more attention. The concerns are that Prince Andrew would become the talking point and overshadow such events, so he might be urged to voluntarily reduce his public visibility over Christmas. Prince Andrew still attends family events and ceremonial occasions, but not always the public moments. For instance, he has attended the annual Order of the Garter ceremony, without taking part in the public procession. Buckingham Palace did not comment, as Prince Andrew is no longer a working royal. The BBC has contacted Prince Andrew for a response. Alleged spy H6 was stopped and questioned by UK border police officers in November 2021, when he also surrendered a number of electronic devices including a mobile phone. In March 2023, H6 was banned entry into the UK by the then-Home Secretary Suella Braverman. He then brought his case to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, a court set up to consider appeals against decisions to ban or remove someone from the country on national security or related grounds. In the published ruling, external, the judges upheld Braverman's decision. H6 has met with many senior figures in the UK, including former Prime Ministers David Cameron and Theresa May, and Prince Andrew, to whom he was described as a \"close confidant\". But Sir Iain said the bigger issue of H6 and Prince Andrew is how China's well-funded attempts to make contact with influential individuals has been happening in \"plain view\". \"The reality is that there are many many more involved in exactly this kind of espionage that's taking place.\" H6 is not allowed to be named under an anonymity order imposed by the courts last week, which Sir Iain called ridiculous. It is believed that some MPs may use parliamentary privilege to name the Chinese businessman. Parliamentary privilege gives MPs and peers unrestricted free speech within the chambers, and allows them to name people without the fear of being taken to court. But others, including Jim McMahon, the minister of housing, communities and local government, believe the naming of H6 is a \"matter for the courts\".

Five are tourists, with one from the US and the rest from Australia, aged between 18 and 56. Two others are foreigners living in Fiji, according to local media reports citing the health ministry. Some were previously reported to be seriously ill, but local officials said on Monday that their symptoms have since improved and some were set to be discharged. The incident comes weeks after the deaths of six tourists in the South East Asian nation of Laos because of suspected methanol poisoning. Fiji tourism chief Brent Hill told RNZ they were keenly aware of the Laos incident, but added that the case in Fiji was \"a long way from that\".  Shortly after drinking the rum cocktail at the Warwick Fiji resort on the Coral Coast, the seven guests displayed nausea, vomiting and neurological symptoms. They were initially taken to Sigatoka Hospital, and later transferred to Lautoka Hospital, according to the Fiji Times. Fiji's tourism minister Viliame Gavok has stressed that this was a \"extremely isolated incident\" and that the resort claimed \"they have not engaged in practices such as substituting ingredients or altering the quality of drinks served to guests\". Initial investigations are under way and no further cases have been reported, authorities said. Sydney resident David Sandoe told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that his daughter Tanya and granddaughter Georgia were among those affected. But he added they were returning home and doing \"very well\" considering what happened. \"It's very difficult to take a call at 11 at night... and your daughter says that they have been poisoned and they're in hospital,\" Mr Sandoe said, adding that Georgia had suffered a seizure. The ABC had previously reported a 56-year-old Australian woman was under medical surveillance in hospital and a 19-year-old Australian woman had suffered \"serious medical episodes\". The Warwick Fiji hotel said in a statement to the BBC that it was aware of the \"suspected alcohol poisoning\" and was taking it \"very seriously\". The hotel said it was \"conducting a thorough investigation\" while awaiting a \"test result report\" from the health authorities to \"gather all necessary information\". Fiji police are said to be investigating the circumstances of the incident. Two Australian families in Fiji are receiving consular assistance, an Australian foreign ministry spokesperson told the BBC. A New Zealand foreign affairs ministry spokesperson told the BBC it had \"not received any requests for assistance\" after the apparent poisoning incident. The BBC also understands that no British persons were affected in the incident. \"There's a real terrifying sense of deja vu,\" Australian minister Jason Clare told the ABC. Two 19-year-old Australian girls had died from suspected methanol poisoning in the Laos incident. Tourists have been advised to \"be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks in Fiji\" by Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). The guidance said tourists should \"get urgent medical help if you suspect drink spiking\".

{"_id":{"$oid":"67600d58c3f742fb3373bb19"},"title_or":"Woman killed in London triple shooting named","description_or":"A woman who was fatally shot in a triple shooting outside a church in north-west London on Saturday evening has been named by the Met Police as Michelle Sadio. The 46-year-old died at the scene after being found with serious injuries when  officers were called out to reports of shots being fired at about 21:15 GMT in Gifford Road, Harlesden. Two men in their 30s sustained serious injuries - one of them remains in a critical condition. There have been no arrests so far. Ms Sadio has not yet been formally identified but the Met has said it is confident about her identity. Her family are being supported by specialist officers, the force said. The BBC understands the shooting happened after a gathering at the River of Life Elim Pentecostal Church on Gifford Road. The building and surrounding area remains cordoned off as police investigations continue. One local resident have told the BBC the sound of \"people screaming\" could be heard coming from the direction of the church. Others said they heard what they thought were fireworks being let off as the incident unfolded.  One resident said he heard five gunshots in a row. The Met's Supt Tony Josephs described the shooting as \"truly shocking\". He added that it was likely to cause concern in the local area and said he hoped witnesses would come forward. \"I want to reassure people that a team of experienced detectives are already working at pace to piece together the events of last night and identify whoever was responsible for this heinous act of violence,\" he said. Ms Sadio is believed to be the first female victim of fatal gun crime in London since 43-year-old Hackney mother Lianne Gordon was shot dead through her front door in December last year.  Ms Gordon was the only woman to die as a result of gun crime in London between 2019-2023 - a period in which 55 men were killed in this way. While gun crime against females remains rare, notable recent non-fatal incidents include the shooting of an eight-year-old girl in Ladbroke Grove in November and that of a nine-year-old girl in Dalston in May.

{"_id":{"$oid":"67600d58c3f742fb3373bb1a"},"title_or":"Royal Mail takeover by Czech billionaire approved","description_or":"The sale of Royal Mail's parent company to a Czech billionaire has been approved by the government.  The £3.6bn takeover by Daniel Kretinsky's EP Group has been given the go-ahead after agreeing \"legally binding\" undertakings. The government will retain a so-called \"golden share\" that will require it to approve any major changes to Royal Mail's ownership, HQ location and tax residency. EP Group will also have to maintain the one-price-goes-anywhere Universal Service Obligation (USO), which currently means it has to deliver letters six days per week, Monday to Saturday, and parcels Monday to Friday. The company has committed to maintaining the USO for as long as it owns Royal Mail. Earlier this year, Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he would honour the service - in whatever form it takes - \"for as long as I am alive\". The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\". Announcing the agreement, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was evidence of the government's commitment to \"working towards ensuring a financially stable Royal Mail with protected links between communities other providers can't reach\". Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings that demonstrate the high regard EP Group has for Royal Mail\". \"EP Group is a long term and committed investor with a mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers,\" he added. The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year. The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years. It has also made commitments to unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run. In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU. The takeover was called in for review under national security laws as it is considered vital national infrastructure. Speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago. Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses. Last week, Royal Mail was fined £10.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail. Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would \"absolutely\" hold Royal Mail to account. Looking ahead she said there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\". Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\". Following Friday's fine, IDS said it had carried out \"substantial\" reforms this year to try to drive improvements. The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels. Meanwhile, parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable. IDS made a small profit last year which was entirely generated by its German and Canadian logistics and parcels business, off-setting losses at Royal Mail. Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he intends to invest heavily in the roll out of delivery lockers to make online deliveries more efficient as has happened across Europe. Daniel Kretinsky started his career as a lawyer in his hometown of Brno, before moving to Prague. He then made serious money in Central and Eastern European energy interests.  This includes Eustream, which transports Russian gas via pipelines that run through Ukraine, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.  He then diversified into other investments, including an almost 10% stake in UK supermarket chain Sainsbury's and a 27% share in Premier League club West Ham United.  The Czech businessman is worth about £6bn, according to reports.

The bodies of 11 foreigners and one Georgian national were found in a sleeping area above a restaurant in Gudauri, the largest and highest ski resort in the former Soviet state, according to officials. Police said \"preliminary tests do not indicate any trace of violence on the bodies\" and it appeared to be an accident, the AFP news agency reported. An oil-powered generator had been turned on after the building lost electricity on Friday, officers added. The bodies were discovered on Saturday on the second floor of a building housing an Indian restaurant. Authorities have opened an investigation into the incident and the identities of the victims have not yet been released. Gudauri is a popular tourist destination for skiing and snowboarding enthusiasts, with a range of winter sports activities for visitors of all levels. Its history dates back to the 19th Century when it was known as a trading post on the ancient Georgian Military Road connecting Russia with Georgia.  Gudauri is located in the Caucasus mountains in the Mtskheta-Mtianeti region at around 2,200m (7,200ft) above sea level and is about 120km (75 miles) north of Georgia's capital Tbilisi.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7r5eky7d1o","published_time":"2024-12-16T10:21:34.278053Z","author_name":"","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4f1c/live/eba08450-bb83-11ef-a2ca-e99d0c9a24e3.jpg.webp"],"source":"bbc","category":"Entertainment","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-16T16:51:34.278Z"}}

{"_id":{"$oid":"67600d58c3f742fb3373bb1d"},"title_or":"Robbie Williams on why he's played by a chimp in new film","description_or":"Robbie Williams is thoroughly enjoying his wander into the world of film, even if he is still learning the correct lingo. \"I was at this thing called the Governors' Ball the other night. That was amazing,\" the singer says. He is talking about the Governors' Awards, held in Los Angeles, where he joined other guests including Tom Hanks, Angelina Jolie and Daniel Craig. \"I'm super excited because it's all brand new to me. I feel like an artist that's just been signed. I'm full of hope, full of excitement, bewildered by it all.\" The project that currently has him walking red carpets with the biggest names in Hollywood is his biopic Better Man. \"Kevin Costner sought me out,\" he giggles, adding with growing incredulity: \"He wanted to come and tell me about the movie.\" Better Man deals with Williams' life from childhood, through the Take That years, to about 2003, the year he broke records by playing three huge gigs at Knebworth (with the aim of annoying Oasis, who had only managed two). The twist in the tale, or tail, is that throughout the film, and with no explanation, he is portrayed on screen as a monkey. At least that is how everyone involved in the film refers to the animal. If Sir David Attenborough veered into film reviewing, he would be quick to point out, in hushed tones, that the creature singing Angels and Rock DJ is a chimpanzee, not a monkey - because it has no tail. To paraphrase the debut album of Williams' old boyband, Ape That and Party. Williams is speaking to me at London's Soho Hotel, a venue so popular with the movie industry that at the exact same time, Rupert Everett is presenting an award on one floor, while in the basement there is a screening of a documentary produced by Jennifer Lawrence. Williams is sitting next to Michael Gracey, the director of 2017 hit The Greatest Showman. Now, after a gap of seven years, Better Man is Gracey's next film, and it was his idea to turn the main man into a monkey. For a year and half, Williams and Gracey had been sending messages back and forth, discussing a possible film musical based on his life. \"There have been a lot of musical biopics,\" says Gracey. \"I wanted to come at this with a different lens. \"Quite often Rob will say, 'I'm just like a performing monkey' or 'I'm up the back like a performing monkey'. \"It just sparked this idea of, we've got this chance to tell this story, not from the perspective of how we see Rob, but how he sees himself. \"And so I pitched the idea to Rob. I said, 'You know, if you were to be an animal, how would you see yourself?'\" Williams takes up the story: \"I was looking for some self-worth at the time and I was like, 'I am a lion'. And he just cocked his head and went, 'Mmmm.' \"I went, 'Monkey?' \"And he went, 'Yeah, so here's the idea.' And before the end of the sentence was out of his mouth, I'm like, 'Yes, that, that, that, please'.\" The monkey was created by Weta, the special effects company responsible for Gollum in Lord of the Rings and Caesar in Planet of the Apes. They used a combination of motion capture and CGI, with the role and the speaking voice taken on by English actor Jonno Davies, best known as Tobias in the Al Pacino TV series Hunters. But it turns out that the original plan was for Williams himself to play the monkey. \"I was going to, but it involved me leaving my family for loads and loads of months,\" he says. \"And the thought of that was just too much for me to bear. \"There are loads of things that I want to do that are just best being an idea. It was great at dinner parties, 'I'm playing me in a story about me.' \"And by the time it came round to it, I was bored of the idea. 'I've said it at dinner parties now. I've done it.'\" Williams did perform the whole of My Way while wired up to help with the motion capture, at a specially arranged pair of concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in 2022. \"We also scanned his eyes,\" explains Gracey, \"So when you look at the monkey's eyes, it's actually one for one Rob's eyes.\" \"I kind of don't want to know which bit's me and which bit's not me,\" interrupts Williams. \"I want the magic of the film just to be the magic of the film. \"Also, Jonno, who plays me, has got a wonderful bottom and I want to believe that bit is me, that my bum will be memorialised as that epic.\" Robbie Williams sums up Better Man as \"the greatest hits of my trauma for the TikTok generation\". And the film doesn't shy away from dealing with his drug addictions and mental health problems, or when Nicole Appleton from All Saints was pregnant with their child and was pressured by people in the music industry, she said, into having an abortion. \"My part in her life I still have shame about. It's the most difficult part of the film for me to watch,\" Williams admits. \"She did me no harm and is a kind, lovely person. I was an idiot younger boyfriend.\" Appleton is supportive of the film and was consulted throughout production - unlike Williams' father Peter Conway, a singer with whom he has performed many times over the years. In Better Man, he is played by Inside No 9's Steve Pemberton and portrayed as someone who let down his family. \"He hasn't seen it yet. And I don't know if I want him to,\" says Williams. \"I haven't spoken to him about it. I'm embarrassed. I love my dad. Best mate, charming, wonderful man. \"But as it is with everybody's childhood, like the Philip Larkin poem, 'They mess you up your mum and dad.' And I'm messing my kids up.\" The film also paints a pretty poisonous portrait of Williams' time in Take That. \"There's a pattern - boys join a boyband, boyband becomes huge, boys get sick. And I don't think anybody gets to escape that,\" is his summary. \"I don't know what it is completely about fame that warps. I just know that it does. I know that young fame, in particular, is corrosive and toxic. It should come with a health warning.\" The death earlier this year of One Direction's Liam Payne, who he mentored on The X Factor in 2010, has made him want to change the way boybands are looked after. \"It's going to take a bunch of creatives to sit around, and I want to head that. I want to do that,\" he says. \"It has to be creative people, not members of Parliament or record company bosses. I think this needs to be oversensitive people with complicated inner lives, who understand what it's like to have a complicated inner life and what help that would need.\" But these plans will have to wait. At the moment, Williams' full attention is on the film and the Oscars. Success in the US is quite a change for a singer who famously never broke America. (Angels reached 53 in the Billboard chart, Millennium 72 and that was it.) In 2002, he even made fun of the situation with the self-deprecating I Will Talk And Hollywood Will Listen, in which the title rhymed with the lyric \"Mr Spielberg look just what you're missing\". How things change. Better Man has already earned a Golden Globe nomination for best song. And on Tuesday, he will find out whether Forbidden Road, which plays over the end credits, is among the 15 songs on the shortlist for the Academy Awards. And there are other categories in which the film could get a nomination. \"Best visual effects,\" starts Gracey, before Williams interjects once more. \"Best musical monkey!\" he beams. Gracey laughs. \"If that was a category, we would definitely win.\" Hollywood is indeed starting to listen. Better Man opens in cinema on 26 December.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7r21egd82o","published_time":"2024-12-16T01:21:36.220866Z","author_name":"Colin Paterson","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f391/live/6fb5b360-bb88-11ef-a2ca-e99d0c9a24e3.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6d1b/live/d995de20-b865-11ef-90f0-f97cf90e571c.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/19ba/live/d91eb8b0-b86d-11ef-a0f2-fd81ae5962f4.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/faa6/live/205eb300-b964-11ef-a937-bb0098f9a5d0.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2319/live/e7eb8cd0-b979-11ef-a2ca-e99d0c9a24e3.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d810/live/c48daf70-b965-11ef-a76e-4d65d4c6203f.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b1eb/live/cb700fc0-bb88-11ef-a0f2-fd81ae5962f4.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6a50/live/bd6471b0-b86c-11ef-a72c-55cc49f950c5.jpg.webp"],"source":"bbc","category":"Entertainment","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-16T16:51:36.221Z"}}
{"_id":{"$oid":"67600d58c3f742fb3373bb1e"},"title_or":"Scandinavian wine industry hoping to win over drinkers","description_or":"Sipping a glass of local wine is likely not what springs to mind when visiting Scandinavia, but this colder, northerly region is emerging as a new wine frontier. Hundreds of commercial vineyards are now dotted across Denmark, Sweden, and even Norway, as a first generation of professional winemakers transform what was once a niche hobby into a small but flourishing industry. Far north of France's Bordeaux or California's Napa Valley, more than 10,000 vines grow on a hillside on Zealand, Denmark's biggest island. \"People have found out that it is actually possible to grow wine in Denmark, so newcomers are coming, year after year,\" says Nina Fink, as she shows the BBC her three-hectare (seven-acre) winery, Vejrhøj Vingård. Nina and her husband Niels started their operation 13 years ago, after retiring from business jobs in Copenhagen. They grow predominantly green grapes, producing floral white wines, as well as sparkling and rosé. \"We have longer summer days with more sunlight than you have in France or in Italy, so the conditions are different,\" she explains. For most Scandinavian vineyards, solaris is the grape of choice - an aromatic, hybrid variety that's well-adapted to colder climes, ripens easily, and is more disease resistant, allowing vineyards to avoid spraying pesticides. The grape was first bred in Germany in 1975, but only adopted in Scandinavia from 2004, after which winemaking took off. Niels Fink says that people are positively surprised when they taste the wines from Vejrhøj Vingård. \"There's a little twinkle in their eye, then comes this half smile,\" he chuckles. \"People like it.\" The Finks sell their bottles direct from the winery, but they also supply some of Copenhagen's top restaurants, including the three Michelin star Geranium. Initially they made just 4,000 bottles annually, but now they sell 20,000. \"We are limited by the supply we are able to offer,\" says Mr Fink. Commercial vineyards in Denmark and Sweden have only been allowed under European Union rules since 2000. Winemaking picked up around 2010, seeing a shift from amateur growers to more ambitious production. Curiosity, and the fact \"it's possible\", has attracted wine entrepreneurs, explains Jean Becker, from the Danish Wine Association. \"I was one of the ones that started in the year 2000. We were six growers,\" says Mr Becker, standing in his vineyard 25km (15 miles) north of Copenhagen. There are now 150 commercial wineries in Denmark with a combined 125 hectares of vines, plus more than 1,000 hobby growers. Meanwhile, Sweden has 47 commercial operators spanning 193 hectares, according to the Swedish Wine Association, and the biggest has 125,000 vines. \"I began with 500 vines,\" said Jean Becker, \"Today, new winegrowers are starting with 15,000-25,000. They start bigger in scale. Is there a market for it? The answer is yes.\" But it's an industry still in its infancy, compared to the 800,000 hectares cultivated in France, and almost a million hectares in Spain. In southern Zealand, Jesper Rye Jensen, who runs Vesterhave Vingaard, produces red wines from varieties like pinot noir and merlot, usually associated with France. \"It is very challenging because it's new for us,\" he says. \"We have to learn it. It's not like southern Europe, where they had generation after generation.\" Data shows that both Denmark and Sweden have seen average temperatures rise almost two degrees celsius over the past 40-50 years, resulting in milder winters and a longer fruit-growing season. But there remains a risk of frost damage. Jesper Rye Jensen says that as a northerly wine producer climate change works in his favour. \"We wine growers in Denmark are happy that we are getting a little bit better weather.\" But Niels Fink reckons that the warming climate is a double-edged sword. \"Climate change is accompanied by all kinds of evils, such as more extreme weather phenomena, long drought, heavy rain. That is as threatening here as it is elsewhere.\" However, Prof Torben Bo Toldam-Andersen, a fruit science researcher from the University of Copenhagen, says that rather than a longer growing season, it is the emergence of new, hardier grapes that largely kick-started the rise of Scandinavian wineries. \"Climate change makes it easier for sure, but the main driver is the new cultivars.\" He is leading a programme called \"FastGrapes\", which tests varieties of vines, to find the most robust and best suited to northern Europe. They are selected according to how quickly their grapes ripen, and their resilience to pests, disease, and other environmental stresses. New seedlings can then be grown on a higher scale. \"There are so many things that go into the perfect wine,\" says the researcher. \"Part of that search happens in the lab… you can see the genes that make it strong.\" The first chosen vines are now growing in 15 test locations, across Scandinavia, Lithuania, northern Germany and Belgium. But even with the best possible grape varieties and warmer weather, Scandinavian wineries face numerous challenges, such as high labour costs and strict rules on the use of chemical treatments to tackle any disease in the vineyards. Romain Chichery says it can also be difficult for wineries to find workers. Born and raised in France, he moved to Sweden shortly after completing his studies in winemaking and viticulture. Now 27, the winemaker works at Thora Vineyard on the country's southwestern Bjäre peninsula. \"We need to train workers, or we have to bring them from outside [the country],\" he says. But ''starting from scratch\" in Sweden, he adds that he enjoys the freedom to experiment. \"It's not just copy paste, which has been done for decades, or centuries, in the older viticulture world.\" Thora's owner, American expat Heather Öberg says all the effort and expense is worth it. \"We can compete with other European wines,\" she says. Yet, home-grown Scandinavian wine currently makes up just a fraction of the consumer market, and bottles are expensive. Danish wine in Denmark costs from 200 kroner ($27; £22) a bottle upwards, more than twice the price of the cheapest French and Spain imports. Only a negligible amount is exported. \"We will never get in competition with France, Italy and Spain because they have very low prices,\" says Mr Becker. At his central Copenhagen wine shop, Vino Fino, owner Nicolai Christiansen mostly sells French wine. Yet he says he has recently sold a case of Danish wine to a bar owner in France. \"If you can sell it to a French guy, you can probably sell it to everybody,\" he jokes. However, he is still to be convinced about Danish wine. \"The Danish wine is still too expensive,\" he says. \"It's coming up. but I still think there's some way to go before the quality is there.\" Sign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

{"_id":{"$oid":"67600d58c3f742fb3373bb1f"},"title_or":"How families' bitter and bloody feud spilled onto Glasgow's streets","description_or":"On the afternoon of 6 December 2006, two men in a blue Mazda pulled up outside a garage in Lambhill, in the north of Glasgow. Raymond Anderson and James McDonald put on old man face masks before stepping out of the car. What happened next was later likened by defence lawyer Donald Findlay KC to \"a scene from The Godfather\". Dressed in trench coats, the pair walked into Applerow Motors, off the busy Balmore Road, and opened fire. The owner, David Lyons, took cover but his 21-year-old nephew Michael was shot dead. Steven Lyons, David's nephew, was injured along with his associate Robert Pickett, who lost a kidney. The hitmen were enforcers for the Daniel crime clan, believed by police to be led by Jamie Daniel. The Daniels were locked in a bitter battle with the Lyons family, who were based in Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire. A bloody gangland feud which had largely been conducted in the shadows was now headline news. The deadly rivalry, which dates back more than 20 years, is now the focus of a new BBC Radio 5 Live true crime podcast. Gangster: The Daniels and the Lyons chronicles the savage battle for control of Glasgow's drugs trade. The six-part series also details the fall-out from multiple shootings and countless tit-for-tat attacks. Ten days after the murder, David Lyons received a \"ransom note\" through the post. It read: \"The boys owe me £25,000 and I want what's owed to me. It's for drugs. \"They all know what it's about as they have got to pay the piper.\" The High Court in Glasgow later heard that Mr Lyons did not pay the money and instead handed the letter to police. Anderson and McDonald were placed under surveillance which eventually led officers to a house in the Garthamlock area where a machine gun, grenades and ammunition were discovered. Both men were heard calling themselves \"The Untouchables\" and talking about the mysterious \"piper\", who was mentioned in the letter sent to Mr Lyons. They were also linked to military weapons which had been stolen from army barracks. In May 2008 Anderson, 49, and McDonald, 27, were convicted and each sentenced to 35 years in jail, which was later reduced on appeal. The judge, Lord Hardie, described the killing as a \"cold-blooded, premeditated assassination\". The murder was rooted in a feud said to date back to 2001 when a £20,000 stash of cocaine disappeared from a Daniel safe house in Milton, in the north of Glasgow, during a party.  Graeme Pearson, former director general of the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency, told the podcast: \"It was alleged that members of the Lyons family group stole a delivery of drugs that were due for the Daniel family and there had been a real upset about the theft of those drugs. \"Equally, it was alleged that the Lyons family had decided that they were also retailing in the north side [of Glasgow], where the Daniel family traditionally had the upper hand. \"This was their territory. This was where they made profit and they wouldn't stand for it. That couldn't go without some response.\" The fall-out from the missing drugs rapidly progressed from car chases to shootings. Among the early victims were Kevin \"Gerbil\" Carroll - a major figure in the Daniel clan - and Johnny Lyons, brother of David and Eddie Snr. Both were shot and injured in separate attacks just 11 days apart in January 2003. Then, in November 2006, Carroll allegedly used a 4x4 and a tow rope to topple the headstone of Eddie Snr's son Garry, who was only eight when he died of leukaemia in 1991.  The desecration of his grave marked a new low. Days later Carroll ambushed and shot Eddie Lyons Jnr and a friend in Bellshill, Lanarkshire. But a week later he was injured in a retaliatory shooting in Bishopbriggs, East Dunbartonshire. Police were deploying significant resources in a bid to manage the dispute but the violence was escalating. It was no secret that Carroll was the most unpredictable player in the whole feud. His rivalry with the Lyons clan stretched back to his schooldays when he was reportedly bullied by members of the family. Carroll, who earned his nickname from a character in the TV puppet series Roland Rat, later forged close friendships with the Daniel clan. Aged 19 he was jailed for three months for car theft and by his mid-20s he was a major criminal player on the north side of Glasgow. In 2004 he was charged with trying to kill a friend of Eddie Lyons Snr with an AK-47 but the trial later collapsed. Carroll - who shared a £217,000 house with Jamie Daniel's daughter in Lennoxtown - could have been forgiven for thinking he was above the law. By 2009 he was out of control and struck fear into rivals by masterminding a series of \"alien abductions\" across central Scotland. The kidnappings were described in such a way as the victims, who were tortured and robbed, told police they couldn't remember anything about their ordeal. Carroll's brutality and pattern of offending ensured he had many enemies and he went to great lengths to cover his tracks. If his rivals wanted to target him then they would have to stage an audacious ambush unlike anything that had gone before. On 13 January 2010 Carroll attended a lunchtime business meeting at Asda in Robroyston, Glasgow. Days earlier he had shot and injured Eddie Lyons Jnr on the arm. Now Carroll had arranged to poach drug pusher Stephen Glen, who was linked to the Lyons family. A trial later heard Carroll, 29, told him: \"You're working for me now. Anybody that doesn't fall into line is going to get banged.\" But at 13:23, minutes after delivering the ultimatum, he was sitting in the back of a black Audi A3 when a speeding Volkswagen Golf screeched to a halt in front of the vehicle. Carroll's two associates fled leaving him trapped in the back of the three-door car. Two masked men emerged from the Golf and opened fire, shattering the rear passenger windows. Carroll was shot in the head and chest - 13 times in total - in an attack that lasted 25 seconds. William \"Buff\" Paterson, fled to Spain 10 days after the murder and later featured in a 10 most wanted appeal by the then UK Serious Organised Crime Agency. But after more than four years on the run he eventually handed himself in at a police station in Madrid. During his trial, at the High Court in Glasgow, Carroll's notoriety was highlighted when a list of 99 potential suspects was read out. Paterson was later convicted and jailed for 22 years. The judge, Lord Armstrong, told him: \"It was not a spontaneous event which happened on the spur of the moment, it was in effect an execution.\" The murder, which was committed in front of horrified lunchtime shoppers, was arguably the most public gangland hit ever carried out in Scotland. It also paved the way for further brazen attacks. In September 2015 Ross Sherlock was shot as he walked down a lane from St Helen's Primary School in Bishopbriggs. At the time the kitchen fitter was chatting to another parent as their daughters walked hand-in-hand in front. Two men were later cleared of the attempted murder. And in January 2017, Ross Monaghan was shot outside St George's Primary School in Penilee, shortly after dropping his daughter off at school. Five years earlier, he had been acquitted of murdering Carroll after a judge ruled there was insufficient evidence. Two men later went on trial for the Monaghan murder bid but were cleared only to be later convicted of other organised crime offences. In between the school shootings there was another major development.  Jamie Daniel, who became a millionaire after starting out as a scrap metal dealer in Possil, died of cancer in July 2016. The convicted heroin smuggler made his fortune through drugs and, latterly, counterfeit cigarettes. But his death, at the age of 58, left a power vacuum and the future of his crime group was cast into doubt. There was no obvious successor, especially as his son Zander Sutherland was serving a 13-and-a-half-year jail term for heroin dealing. Sutherland later fled the UK while on day release from prison and is now in Norway fighting extradition. Meanwhile, the Lyons group responded to Daniel's death with a brutal campaign of intimidation against his associates, which included five attempted murders in five months. Robert Daniel was the first target. On 8 December 2016 his car was rammed by another vehicle before he was chased into a house in Robroyston. Once inside he was struck twice on the back of the head with what he later told police was a hatchet or a machete. Asked in court if he was aware of any ill-feeling between the Daniel and Lyons families, Robert, 29, replied: \"Not that I know of.\" A month later Thomas Bilsland, 31, suffered a fractured skull after he was set upon in Glasgow's Cranhill. The next victim, Gary Petty, was targeted after he visited an Italian restaurant on 7 March 2017. A court heard the 22-year-old was getting out his Volkswagen Golf when he was ambushed in Maryhill. Ryan Fitzsimmons, 34, was attacked by a masked gang on 28 April 2017 outside his home in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire. The former soldier, who was left brain damaged, told the trial: \"It felt like death was coming.\" His mother Geraldine, 61, was so affected by what happened that she suffered a heart attack in the street. Mr Fitzsimmons told jurors he had \"no enemies\" but jurors heard his older brother was once charged with shooting Ross Monaghan, the man cleared of murdering Carroll in 2010. The most savage crime on the 13-page indictment was the assault on Stephen \"Bonzo\" Daniel on 18 May 2017. As he headed home after dropping off friends his Skoda Octavia was deliberately hit by a Volkswagen Golf in Milton. An Audi S3 soon joined the chase through north Glasgow during which the vehicles involved reach speeds of up to 100mph. Daniel's car eventually crashed on an off ramp of the M8 in the Port Dundas area. The impact left him unconscious and the 39-year-old later told a court he had no memory of what happened next. As he lay slumped at the wheel Daniel was subjected to a horrific attack with bladed weapons which left him with facial wounds so severe that first responders initially thought he had been shot. The court also heard the ex-taxi firm director's car was found to have had a tracking device on it but he insisted he had no enemies before the incident. Gangland investigations pose a massive challenge for law enforcement as detectives are typically met with a wall of silence. But the sophisticated technology deployed by the Lyons group to plot the attacks also enabled officers to build a case against them. And in May 2019 six associates of the family were jailed for a total of 104 years after being found guilty of five murder plots. The judge, Lord Mulholland, told the gang: \"You sought to turn Glasgow into a war zone for your feud. \"This is a civilised city, which is based on the rule of law. \"There is no place for this type of conduct, retribution or the law of the jungle.\" Five years on, the feud - which has also been linked to a number of prison attacks - is back in the spotlight. And presenter Livvy Haydock described the new podcast as the \"most bloody and brutal\" Gangster series to date. She added: \"This investigation has been eye-opening and uncovers the story of two of Glasgow's most notorious crime families. \"It's a vicious war which has raged on for 20 years and is still going on to this day.\" Gangster: The Daniels and the Lyons is available as a boxset on BBC Sounds and on other platforms weekly.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20e6g5xdx9o","published_time":"2024-12-16T06:21:37.765999Z","author_name":"Paul O'Hare","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3ca6/live/4a64c1a0-b7dc-11ef-a2ca-e99d0c9a24e3.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2b7b/live/cbc06430-b178-11ef-a2ca-e99d0c9a24e3.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5072/live/9eb14200-b7e7-11ef-a2ca-e99d0c9a24e3.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7591/live/5c6509d0-b7d4-11ef-a9d0-3bb2d253170d.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4a62/live/0bdbf3e0-b7e6-11ef-a2ca-e99d0c9a24e3.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/594a/live/1a0710f0-b177-11ef-84e6-298a2db62aed.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d273/live/9bc36b80-b7d4-11ef-a0f2-fd81ae5962f4.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4a83/live/4a66e380-b7e7-11ef-aff0-072ce821b6ab.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/78ab/live/2373b2f0-b7ea-11ef-a0f2-fd81ae5962f4.jpg.webp"],"source":"bbc","category":"Business","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-16T16:51:37.766Z"}}
{"_id":{"$oid":"67600d58c3f742fb3373bb20"},"title_or":"Why Final Fantasy director almost rejected his dream job","description_or":"When Naoki Hamaguchi found out he'd landed his dream job directing remakes of his favourite game, Final Fantasy VII, he almost didn't accept. \"I realised this was going to be 10 years of my life as a games developer and I was a little torn,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat. As video games have become more advanced the time - and budgets - needed to create them have grown. For the people in charge of those projects it can mean committing a big chunk of your life, career and identity to them. And there are few projects on the scale of the new Final Fantasy VII series. A trilogy of games remaking the beloved 1997 classic with updated visuals, full voice-acting and a wealth of side content, it is a massive undertaking. So far, it has gone well. The first two games, subtitled Remake and Rebirth, released to excellent reviews and both were nominated for a string of awards. Mr Hamaguchi most recently accepted a Game Award for best score and music at the industry's biggest ceremony in Los Angeles. Newsbeat speaks to him at the Golden Joysticks in London, where Rebirth scoops prizes for Best Soundtrack, Best Storytelling and performance. The initial announcement of developer Square Enix's intention to split the project into three was met with some scepticism - the original game could be completed in about 40 hours. So does Mr Hamaguchi think he's proved the doubters wrong? \"I hope we've convinced them,\" he says.  \"With the original being so famous, so many people have their own visions of what Final Fantasy VII is. It’s very difficult to please absolutely every single fan out there.\" Despite his own concerns about the remakes taking up so much of his professional life, he says he's happy he took the plunge. \"Final Fantasy was one of the big inspirations for me to want to become a game creator in the first place,\" he says.  \"This was my way of giving back to the series.\" But he admits he's looking forward to doing something different.  \"I want to move away from it an take on a completely new kind of challenge\", he says. \"I've given everything I have to this.\" Mr Hamaguchi says the game development climate when the first game was released means the approach to making the new games is fundamentally different. Because it takes years to make a blockbuster game for modern machines, he says teams need to think about how the landscape will look in five to ten years' time. For example, emerging markets such as the Middle East and South East Asia \"are undergoing very rapid economic growth\" and creating a new generation of gamers.  \"It's really interesting to see so many young people getting into gaming in these regions,\" he says. In contrast to making a game 20 years ago, developers need to make sure cultural references work across regions where video games are more popular than they once were. The games market is tougher, too.  Square Enix has said Rebirth - which released exclusively on PlayStation 5 - did not perform as well as it had hoped, and it recently confirmed a PC version would be coming soon. People play on more platforms and there's evidence that many gamers are sticking with a \"home game\" such as Fortnite, Roblox or Call of Duty for longer periods. Drawing them away is hard, but Mr Hamaguchi says the buzz from an awards nomination can give a game a boost.  \"Previously we'd release a game on a console and it would sell very well for the first couple of weeks,\" he says.  An award mention can help a title stand out from the crowd and push it to the front page of online storefronts. Final Fantasy VII's history stretches back more than 20 years, but does Mr Hamaguchi have any thoughts on where gaming might be in the same amount of time in the future? \"Something along the lines of virtual reality, or perhaps more like augmented reality, where you can create a digital environment which merges with the real world and people can interact with things in that world,\" he says. \"I think that’s a very different feeling to what we have when we play games with a standard controller today\".  He also predicts headsets could become cheap and lightweight enough so we can enter and interact with games in much more immersive ways.  For now, thought, he'll be focusing on the final part of the new trilogy, hoping to be up on the awards stage again.

{"_id":{"$oid":"67600d58c3f742fb3373bb21"},"title_or":"Gisèle Pelicot removes all traces of her husband from her life","description_or":"Warning: This story contains descriptions of sexual abuse It was November 2011, and Gisèle Pelicot was sleeping too much. She spent most of her weekends in a slumber. She was annoyed, because during the week she worked hard as a supply chain manager, and her time off was precious.  Yet she could not seem to stay awake, often drifting off without even realising it and waking hours later with no memory of having gone to bed. Despite this, Gisèle, 58, was happy. She counted herself lucky to have her husband of 38 years, Dominique, by her side. Now their three children Caroline, David and Florian were grown, the couple were planning to soon retire and move to Mazan, a village of 6,000 people in France's idyllic southern region of Provence, where Mr Pelicot could go on bike rides and she could take Lancôme, their French bulldog, on long walks. She had loved Dominique since they met in the early 1970s. \"When I saw that young man in a blue jumper it was love at first sight,\" Gisèle would reflect, much later. They both had complicated family histories marked by loss and trauma, and had found peace with one another. Their four decades together had hit rough patches - frequent financial troubles and her affair with a colleague in the mid-1980s – but they had made it through. Years later, when asked by a lawyer to sum up their relationship, she said: \"Our friends used to say we were the perfect couple. And I thought we would see our days through together.\" By that point, Gisèle and Dominique were sitting on opposite sides of a courtroom in Avignon, not far from Mazan: she surrounded by their children and her lawyers, and he, dressed in grey, prison-issue clothes, in the defendants' glass box. He was facing the maximum jail term for aggravated rape and was rapidly becoming known in France and beyond as – in his own daughter's words – \"one of the worst sexual predators of the last 20 years\". But in 2011, when Gisèle felt she was sleeping too much, she couldn't have guessed that was how things would play out. She had no idea that, in his late 50s and nearing retirement, her husband Dominique Pelicot had been spending a lot of time on the internet, often talking to users on open forums and chatrooms where sexual material – often extreme or illegal – was freely available. In court, he would later pinpoint that phase as the trigger for his \"perversion\" after a childhood trauma of rape and abuse: \"We become perverted when we find something that gives us the means: the internet.\" Sometime between 2010 and 2011, a man claiming to be a nurse sent Mr Pelicot photos of his wife, drugged with sleeping pills to the point of unconsciousness. He also shared precise instructions with Mr Pelicot so that he could do the same to Gisèle. At first he hesitated – but not for long. Through trial and error he realised that with the right dosage of pills he could plunge his wife into a sleep so deep nothing would wake her. They had been lawfully prescribed by his doctor, who thought Mr Pelicot suffered from anxiety due to financial troubles. He would then be able to dress her in lingerie she refused to wear, or put her through sexual practices she would have never accepted while conscious. He could film the scenes, which she would not have allowed while awake. Initially, he was the only one raping her. But by the time the couple had settled in Mazan in 2014, he had perfected and expanded his operation. He kept tranquilisers in a shoebox in the garage, and switched brands because the first tasted \"too salty\" to be surreptitiously added to his wife's food and drink, he said later. On a chatroom called \"without her knowledge\" he recruited men of all ages to come and abuse his wife. He would film them too. He told the court his wife's unconscious state was clear to the 71 men who came to their house over the course of a decade. \"You're just like me, you like rape mode,\" he told one of them in the chat. As the years went by, the effects of the abuse Ms Pelicot was subjected to at night increasingly began to seep into her waking life. She lost weight, clumps of hair fell out and her blackouts became more frequent. She was riddled with anxiety, certain that she was nearing death. Her family became worried. She had seemed healthy and active when she had visited them. \"We'd ring her but most of the time it was Dominique who picked up. He would tell us Gisèle was asleep, even in the middle of the day,\" said her son-in-law Pierre. \"But it seemed likely because she was doing so much [when she was with us], especially running after the grandchildren.\" Sometimes, Gisèle came close to having suspicions. Once, she had noticed the green colour of a beer her husband had handed her, and hastily poured it down the sink. Another time, she noticed a bleach stain she couldn't recall making on a new pair of trousers. \"You're not drugging me by any chance, are you?\" she remembered asking him. He broke down in tears: \"How can you accuse me of such a thing?\" Mostly, though, she felt lucky to have him with her as she navigated her health issues. She developed gynaecological problems, and underwent several neurological tests to determine if she was suffering from Alzheimer's or a brain tumour, as she feared, but the results didn't explain the increasing tiredness and the blackouts. Several years later, during the trial, Dominique's brother Joel, a doctor, was asked how it was possible that medical professionals had never put the clues together and understood Gisèle was a victim of the little-known phenomenon of chemical submission – drug-facilitated rape. \"In the field of medicine we only find what we're looking for, and we look for what we know,\" he replied. Gisèle only felt better when she was away from Mazan – an oddity she barely noticed. It was on her return from one of these trips, in September 2020, that Dominique told her, in floods of tears: \"I did something stupid. I was caught filming under women's clothes in a supermarket,\" she recalled during the trial.  She was very surprised, she said, because \"in 50 years he had never behaved inappropriately or used obscene words towards women\". She said she forgave him but asked him to promise her he would seek help. He acquiesced, \"and we left it at that\", she said. But Dominique must have known the end was near.  Soon after he was arrested in the supermarket, police confiscated his two phones and his laptop, where they would inevitably find more than 20,000 videos and photos of his wife being raped by him and others. \"I watched those videos for hours. It was troubling. Of course it had an impact on me,\" Jérémie Bosse Platière, the director of the investigation, told the court.  \"In 33 years in the police, I'd never really seen that sort of thing,\" his colleague Stéphane Gal said. \"It was sordid, it was shocking.\" His team was tasked with tracking down the men in the videos. They cross-checked the faces and names of the men carefully logged by Dominique alongside facial recognition technology. They were eventually able to identify 54 of them, while another 21 remained nameless. Some of the men who were unidentified said in conversations with Dominique that they were also drugging their partners. \"That, for me, is the most painful part of the case,\" Mr Bosse Platière said. \"To know that there are some women out there who could still be victims of their husbands.\" On 2 November 2020, Dominique and Gisèle had breakfast together before heading to a police station, where Mr Pelicot had been summoned in relation to the upskirting incident. She was asked by a policeman to follow him into another room. She confirmed Dominque was her husband -  \"a great guy, a good man\" –  but denied ever taking part in swinging with him, or engaging in threesomes. \"I will show you something you won't like,\" the police chief warned her, before showing her a picture of a sexual act.  At first, she didn't recognise any of the two people.  When she did, \"I told him to stop... Everything caved in, everything I built for 50 years\". She was sent home in a state of shock, accompanied by a friend. She had to tell her children what had happened. Recalling that moment, Gisèle said that her \"daughter's screams are forever etched in my mind\". Caroline, David and Florian came down to Mazan and cleared out the house. Later, photos of a seemingly drugged Caroline were also found on Dominique's laptop, although he has denied abusing her. David, the eldest child, said they no longer had any family photos because they \"got rid of everything linked to my father there and then\". Within days, Gisèle's life was reduced to a suitcase and her dog. Meanwhile, Dominique admitted to his crimes and was formally arrested. He thanked police for \"relieving him of a burden\". He and Gisèle wouldn't meet again until they sat facing one another in the Avignon courtroom in September 2024. By then, the story of the husband who drugged his wife for a decade and invited strangers to rape her had started to ripple across the world, aided by Gisèle's unusual and remarkable decision to waive her anonymity and open the trial to the public and the media. \"I want any woman who wakes up one morning with no memories of the night before to remember what I said,\" she stated. \"So that no more women can fall prey to chemical submission. I was sacrificed on the altar of vice, and we need to talk about it.\" Her legal team also successfully pushed for the videos taken to be shown in court, arguing they would \"undo the thesis of accidental rape\" – pushing back against the line of defence that the men had not meant to rape Gisèle as they didn't realise she was unconscious. \"She wanted shame to change sides and it has,\" a woman who came to watch the trial in Avignon said in November. \"Gisèle turned everything on its head. We weren't expecting a woman like this.\" Medical examiner Anne Martinat Sainte-Beuve said that in the wake of her husband's arrest, Gisèle was clearly traumatised but calm and distant – a coping mechanism often employed by survivors of terrorist attacks. Gisèle herself has said that she is \"a field of ruins\" and that she fears the rest of her life may not be enough to rebuild herself.  Ms Sainte-Beuve said she had found Gisèle \"exceptionally resilient\": \"She turned what could have destroyed her into strength.\" Days before the trial started, the Pelicots' divorce was finalised. Gisèle has gone back to her maiden name. She went by the name Pelicot for the trial so that her grandchildren could be \"proud\" of being related to her and not ashamed of being associated to Dominique. She has since moved to a village far from Mazan. She sees a psychiatrist but doesn't take any medication, because she no longer wants to ingest any substance. She continues to go on long walks, but is no longer tired. In the early days of the trial, Caroline's husband Pierre took the stand. A defence lawyer asked him about the Mazan years, when Gisèle was suffering from memory loss and her husband was dutifully accompanying her to unfruitful medical appointments. How could the family not have realised what was happening? Pierre shook his head. \"You are forgetting one thing,\" he said. \"You cannot imagine the unimaginable.\" If you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgx7xy77ydo","published_time":"2024-12-15T11:21:40.009853Z","author_name":"Laura Gozzi","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/019c/live/22a0f310-ba2e-11ef-a0f2-fd81ae5962f4.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a370/live/1b672490-ba27-11ef-a0f2-fd81ae5962f4.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/422e/live/ecd66630-ba18-11ef-a0f2-fd81ae5962f4.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/848a/live/2a3bb700-ba19-11ef-a2ca-e99d0c9a24e3.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8c36/live/8d2a0f20-ba18-11ef-aff0-072ce821b6ab.jpg.webp"],"source":"bbc","category":"Business","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-16T16:51:40.01Z"}}
{"_id":{"$oid":"67600d58c3f742fb3373bb22"},"title_or":"'We just need peace': BBC speaks to Syrians watching Israel's incursion","description_or":"An hour's drive from Damascus, on a country road into the Syrian village of Hadar, we meet Israel's army. Two military vehicles and several soldiers in full combat gear man an impromptu checkpoint – a foreign authority in a country celebrating its freedom. They waved us through. It was evidence of Israel's incursion into Syrian territory – the temporary seizure, it said, of a UN-monitored buffer zone, set up in a ceasefire agreement 50 years ago. \"Maybe they'll leave, maybe they'll stay, maybe they'll make the area safe then go away,\" said Riyad Zaidan, who lives in Hadar. \"We want to hope, but we'll have to wait and see.\" The village chief, Jawdat al-Tawil, pointed to the Golan Heights territory Israel occupied in 1967, clearly visible from Hadar's terraces. Many residents here have relatives still living there. Now, they see Israeli forces routinely moving around their own village, parts of which jut into the demilitarized zone. On a slope above, Israeli bulldozers can be seen working on the hillside. A week after President Assad's regime fell, the sense of freedom here comes tinged with fatalism. Jawdat al-Tawil told me proudly how the village had defended itself against militia groups during the Syrian civil war, and showed me portraits of the dozens of men who had died doing so. \"We don't allow anyone to transgress on our land,\" he said. \"[But] Israel is a state – we can't stand against it. We used to stand up to individuals, but Israel is a super-power.\" Since the fall of Syria's former president Bashar al-Assad earlier this month, Israel has also carried out hundreds of airstrikes on military targets across Syria. And Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has announced new plans to double the population of Israeli settlements in the occupied Golan Heights, saying the move was needed because of \"the new front\" that had opened up in Syria. Speaking before that plan was unveiled, Syria's interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa warned Israel's military manoeuvres risked unwarranted escalation in the region and said his administration did not want conflict with Israel. The Israeli Foreign Ministry said its actions were necessary because of threats posed by jihadist groups operating along the ceasefire line with Syria, describing its military incursions there as \"limited and temporary\". The residents of Hadar belong mainly to the Druze community – a tight-knit, introverted group which splintered from mainstream Shia Islam centuries ago. When Israel occupied part of the Golan Heights in the 1967 war, and later unilaterally annexed it, some of the Druze there opted to remain and take Israeli citizenship. Al-Sharaa, the leader of the Syrian militia Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) that forced President Assad from power this month, has his family roots in the occupied Golan Heights. Some here on the Syrian-controlled side fear Israel's plan is to grab more territory for itself. For years, Israel has been battling the Iran-backed militia there that supported Assad. This border region is a key weapons-supply route between Tehran and the proxy forces it maintains, including the Lebanese militia Hezbollah. Assad's fall has left those groups – and Iran – weaker. But Israel has since stepped up its military campaign, taking advantage of the political vacuum to extend its reach. It has also been targeting military equipment left by Assad's forces at bases across the country, worried about who might end up using it in the future. Israel's Defence Minister, Israel Katz, said on Sunday that the \"immediate risks\" to Israel remained, and the recent developments in Syria had increased the threat, \"despite the moderate appearance that rebel leaders claim to present\". Marginalised by the Assad regime, and targeted as infidels by Sunni jihadist groups like HTS, Syria's Druze are more tolerant of Israel than many other communities here. The village used to fight against the Iran-backed groups Israel sees as a threat here, but Jawdat al-Tawil told me that alliances in the area were shifting, and that he was now talking to these groups about reaching a deal. Syria is not a place where people have relied on only one ally, or fight only one enemy. \"We just need peace,\" resident Riyad Zaidan told me. \"We've had enough war, enough blood, enough hard life – we need to stop.\" Religious minorities like the Druze suffered under Assad. The country's new leaders from HTS have promised tolerance and respect for Syria's diverse ethnic and religious groups. But eight years ago the group was still aligned with global jihadist groups like al-Qaeda. It was around the time HTS split from al-Qaeda in 2016 that Jawdat al-Tawil's son, Abdo, was killed by their militiamen on the outskirts of Hadar, while fighting for the Syrian Army. He showed me the path where 30-year-old Abdo died and I asked how he felt about HTS taking control of Syria now. \"At first, they were gangs. Now they have got rid of the tyrant [Assad], and have come to power,\" he said. \"They're supposed to rule with justice, provide safety and ensure people's rights.\" \"It's not clear yet if they've changed,\" he said. \"I hope so.\" Additional reporting by Yousef Shomali, Charlotte Scarr and Mayar Mohanna","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgm9w2ym39go","published_time":"2024-12-15T22:21:40.829479Z","author_name":"Lucy Williamson","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"Hadar, Golan Heights","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a94d/live/3a0560b0-bb30-11ef-b873-c537f6119ec3.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/290d/live/87512b50-bb31-11ef-a0f2-fd81ae5962f4.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9306/live/b9598210-bb30-11ef-b873-c537f6119ec3.jpg.webp"],"source":"bbc","category":"World","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-16T16:51:40.829Z"}}
{"_id":{"$oid":"67600d58c3f742fb3373bb23"},"title_or":"Why a nation of 1.45 billion wants more children","description_or":"Last year, India nudged past China to become the world's most populous country, according to UN estimates. With nearly 1.45 billion people now, you'd think the country would be quiet about having more children. But guess what? The chatter has suddenly picked up. Leaders of two southern states – Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu – have recently advocated more children. Andhra Pradesh is mulling providing incentives, citing low fertility rates and ageing population. The state also scrapped its \"two-child policy\" for local body elections, and reports say neighbouring Telangana may soon do the same. Next-door Tamil Nadu is also making similar, more exaggerated, noises. India's fertility rate has fallen substantially - from 5.7 births per woman in 1950 to the current rate of two.  Fertility rates have fallen below the replacement level of two births per woman in 17 of the 29 states and territories. (A replacement level is one at which new births are sufficient to maintain a stable population.) The five southern Indian states lead India's demographic transition, achieving replacement-level fertility well ahead of others. Kerala reached the milestone in 1988, Tamil Nadu in 1993, and the rest by the mid-2000s. Today, the five southern states have total fertility rates below 1.6, with Karnataka at 1.6 and Tamil Nadu at 1.4. In other words, fertility rates in these states match or are less than many European countries. But these states fear that India's shifting demographics with varying population shares between states, will significantly impact electoral representation and state wise-allocation of parliamentary seats and federal revenues.  \"They fear being penalised for their effective population control policies, despite being better economic performers and contributing significantly to federal revenues,\" Srinivas Goli, a professor of demography at the International Institute for Population Sciences, told the BBC. Southern states are also grappling with another major concern as India prepares for its first delimitation of electoral seats in 2026 - the first since 1976. This exercise will redraw electoral boundaries to reflect population shifts, likely reducing parliamentary seats for the economically prosperous southern states. As federal revenues are allocated based on state populations, many fear this could deepen their financial struggles and limit policy-making freedom. Demographers KS James and Shubhra Kriti project that populous northern states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar stand to gain more seats from delimitation, while southern states such as Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh could face losses, further shifting political representation. Many, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have hinted that changes to fiscal shares and parliamentary seat allocations will not be rushed through.  \"As a demographer, I don't think states should be overly concerned about these issues. They can be resolved through constructive negotiations between federal and state governments,\" says Mr Goli. \"My concern lies elsewhere.\" The key challenge, according to demographers, is India's rapid ageing driven by declining fertility rates. While countries like France and Sweden took 120 and 80 years respectively to double their aging population from 7% to 14%, India is expected to reach this milestone in just 28 years, says Mr Goli. This accelerated ageing is tied to India's unique success in fertility decline. In most countries, improved living standards, education, and urbanisation naturally lower fertility as child survival improves. But in India, fertility rates fell rapidly despite modest socio-economic progress, thanks to aggressive family welfare programmes that promoted small families through targets, incentives, and disincentives.  The unintended consequence? Take Andhra Pradesh, for instance. Its fertility rate is 1.5, on par with Sweden, but its per capita income is 28 times lower, says Mr Goli. With mounting debt and limited resources, can states like these support higher pensions or social security for a rapidly aging population?  Consider this. More than 40% of elderly Indians (60+ years) belong to the poorest wealth quintile - the bottom 20% of a population in terms of wealth distribution, according to United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)'s latest India Ageing Report. In other words, Mr Goli says, \"India is getting old before getting rich\". Fewer children also mean a rising old-age dependency ratio, leaving fewer caregivers for an expanding elderly demographic. Demographers warn that India's healthcare, community centres and old-age homes are unprepared for this shift. Urbanisation, migration, and changing labour markets are further eroding traditional family support - India's strong point - leaving more elderly people behind.  While migration from populous to less populous states can ease the working-age gap, it also sparks anti-migration anxieties. \"Robust investments in prevention, palliative care, and social infrastructure are urgently needed to look after the ageing,\" says  Mr Goli. As if the southern states' concerns weren't enough, earlier this month, the chief of the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (National Volunteers' Organisation), the ideological backbone of Mr Modi's BJP -  urged couples to have at least three children to secure India's future. \"According to population science, when growth falls below 2.1, a society perishes on its own. Nobody destroys it,\" Mohan Bhagwat reportedly said at a recent meeting. While Mr Bhagwat's concerns may have some basis, they are not entirely accurate, say demographers. Tim Dyson, a demographer at the London School of Economics, told the BBC that after a decade or two, continuing \"very low levels of fertility will lead to rapid population decline\". A fertility rate of 1.8 births per woman leads to a slow, manageable population decline. But a rate of 1.6 or lower could trigger \"rapid, unmanageable population decline\".   \"Smaller numbers of people will enter the reproductive - and main working - ages, and this will be socially, politically and economically disastrous. This is a demographic process and it is extremely difficult to reverse,\" says Mr Dyson. This is already happening in some countries. In May, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared the country's record-low birth rate a \"national emergency\" and announced plans for a dedicated government ministry. Greece's fertility rate has plummeted to 1.3, half of what it was in 1950, sparking warnings from Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis about an \"existential\" population threat.  But demographers say that urging people to have more children is futile. \"Considering the societal shifts, including the significant reduction in gender disparities as women's lives have become increasingly similar to those of men, this trend is unlikely to reverse,\" says Mr Dyson. WATCH: Why do some in India want couples to have more children? For Indian states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala, grappling with a declining workforce, the key question is: who will step in to fill the gap? Developed countries, unable to reverse declining fertility, are focusing on healthy and active ageing - prolonging working life by five to seven years and enhancing productivity in older populations. Demographers say India will need to extend retirement ages meaningfully, and policies must prioritise increasing healthy years through better health screenings, and stronger social security to ensure an active and productive older population - a potential \"silver dividend\". India must also leverage its demographic dividend better - economic growth that occurs when a country has a large, working-age population. Mr Goli believes there's a window of opportunity until 2047 to boost the economy, create jobs for the working-age population, and allocate resources for the ageing. \"We're only reaping 15-20% of the dividend - we can do much better,\" he says.

{"_id":{"$oid":"67600d58c3f742fb3373bb25"},"title_or":"Turkey and sprouts drives down cost of Christmas dinner","description_or":"Falling turkey and Brussels sprout prices mean Christmas dinner will cost a little less at the supermarket checkout this year. The price of Brussels sprouts has fallen by 12%, while a 10lb (4.55kg) frozen turkey will cost you £1.21 less than it did last year, research for the BBC suggests. But digging deeper we discovered root vegetables have gone up in price this year, after wet weather delayed the planting season. When all the trimmings are totted up, a family Christmas is set to cost £31.66 in 2024, down from last year's figure of £32.18. It reflects food prices rising at a slower rate in the past year, as UK inflation has eased. The annual change in price for products across Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda, Morrisons, Aldi and Lidl were measured by Retail tracking platform Assosia.  The crown of the Christmas feast, the turkey, has fallen in price by 6% this year, according to this data. Tom Copas, managing director of Copas Turkeys in Cookham, Berkshire, said the price of turkeys had begun to stabilise after a couple of \"incredibly turbulent\" years that had pushed up the cost of rearing his birds. \"Hence we're seeing incremental changes in prices year on year, rather than dramatic ones,\" added Mr Copas, whose family has been rearing turkeys since 1957. However, Mr Copas says he'd seen slower sales and more demand for smaller turkeys this year, perhaps indicating customers were tightening their belts. \"It's possibly people are trying to keep the overall basket spend down.\" Brussels sprouts came in at 12p cheaper for a 500g bag compared to last year. Hot summers and sudden cold snaps of the previous two years had made things hard for producers, says John Inglis, senior commercial manager at ESG Drysdale, one of the UK's largest sprout producers.  But he says this year has seen us return \"back to normality\" after \"a couple of tricky seasons\" and sprouts are thriving again. Root vegetables were behind the largest price changes in our Christmas shop. Maris Piper potatoes have seen a whopping 26% increase, with a typical 2kg bag up from £1.58 to £1.99. Tracy Bush, co-director of Provenance Potatoes in Kent, says poor weather has had a lot to do with the price of spuds going up in recent years. \"We've had a particularly wet spring so planting was difficult for any root crops, and then the autumn when crops are lifted and harvested, that was also very difficult,\" she says. Carrot farmer Rodger Hobson says the same wet weather delayed this year's carrot planting season. Last year, the weather was so bad that supermarkets had to import carrots. This year, they've gone up by 13.4% to 69p per kilo. But Mr Hobson says he would not be surprised if \"when it comes to Christmas week they'll be down to 20p a kilo\". This is because carrots are often chosen as \"loss leaders\" in supermarkets. They're sold at a loss to attract customers in to spend on more profitable items. Ged Futter is a retail specialist who used to be a buyer for Asda. He says supermarkets drastically reduce their prices in the week before Christmas.  \"Every year they do the same thing,\" he says, noting that supermarkets usually fight for customers with cut price \"potatoes, carrots, parsnips, Brussels spouts\". Mr Hobson says perishable items make for good loss leaders because customers can't stockpile them when they are cheap. If supermarkets reduced the price of long-life items like baked beans, shoppers might be tempted to buy their year's supply in December, he says. While loss-leaders are good for shoppers, Mr Futter stressed these below-cost prices \"don't show the true cost to the farmer\" and can generate a lot of food waste. \"People think that food is cheap to produce - that's not true.\" This year price rises were not confined to the main meal - the cost of Christmas desserts also went up. Christmas pudding is 11% more expensive than in 2023, and mince pies are up by 5%, according to Assosia's research.  Jessica White, the owner of Meg Rivers artisan bakery, says: \"Our costs have indeed gone up of ingredients, packaging, wages and like everyone - electricity.\" But she says her company had chosen not to put prices up this year. They have already sold out of Christmas puddings and have had to make more to fulfil the waiting list, she says. \"We make more and more each year and don't notice a drop in demand.\" BBC News also looked into how the cost of a Christmas dinner might vary depending on where you shop. We compared prices on the websites of the UK's top five supermarkets - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Morrisons and Aldi. Our snapshot from one day suggests Aldi was the cheapest supermarket for a basic list of Christmas essentials, at around £24.30. Asda was second cheapest at £28.22, followed by Morrisons and Sainsbury's.  Tesco was most expensive at £36.51. Last year, our research suggested Morrisons was the most expensive, with Tesco third. While we tried to find equivalent items across all five supermarkets, there are some small differences in product sizes or types. So the cost of your Christmas dinner might vary between supermarkets and the items you choose. Prices will also vary the closer we get to Christmas as supermarket competition becomes even more fierce. Our BBC analysis should not be directly compared with the price rise figures from retail analysis firm Assosia as we both use a slightly different basket. Start with a budget: Plan ahead and add up hidden expenses, like tin foil for roasting a turkey.

Bhim Kohli died on 2 September, a day after being attacked at Franklin Park in Braunstone Town while walking his dog Rocky. The girl, who cannot be named because of her age, appeared at Leicester Youth Court - sitting at Leicester Magistrates' Court - earlier and was released on bail. She is next due at Leicester Crown Court on 3 February. A 15-year-old boy has previously been charged with Mr Kohli's murder. He is due to enter a plea at Leicester Crown Court on Wednesday, and a provisional trial date of 17 February has been set. Leicestershire Police said the attack occurred near the park's Bramble Way entrance at about 18:30 BST on 1 September. A post-mortem examination found Mr Kohli died of a neck injury. In a statement, his family described him as \"a loving husband, dad and grandad\". \"Bhim loved to laugh,\" they said. \"He was always very happy and talkative, the joker of the family and always loved to outsmart us with a smile.\" Because of prior police contact with the victim, Leicestershire Police made a voluntary referral to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC). Following further contact with the IOPC, the force then made a mandatory referral. \"We will carry out an assessment to decide what further action may be required from us,\" an IOPC spokesperson added.

{"_id":{"$oid":"67600d58c3f742fb3373bb28"},"title_or":"'Our rapists should admit guilt before they get parole'","description_or":"Two survivors say rapists should not be allowed out of prison before they have served their full sentences unless they have admitted guilt and shown remorse. Ellie Wilson and Hannah McLaughlan have waived their right to anonymity and are now calling for changes to the parole system, which decides when certain prisoners can be released. One of their requests is clearer information for victims about the parole process. The Parole Board for Scotland said its role was to assess whether it was safe for an offender to be released from prison to serve the rest of their sentence in the community. It said all relevant information was taken into account. Ellie Wilson's rapist was sentenced to five years in prison in July 2022. Like many prisoners, he is entitled by law to be considered for parole once he has served half his sentence. Ellie is due to find out this month whether he will be released under supervision. Over the summer she received a letter asking if she wanted to make representations to the parole board ahead of his possible release. Ellie told BBC Scotland News that the parole system was confusing. She said: \"The criteria with which they make decisions about parole isn't clear to see, it's not clear to understand, it's certainly not made clear to the victims going through the system.\" She said there should be better public scrutiny about how decisions are reached. The board's website says it will consider the likelihood of reoffending by taking account of the nature of the offence, previous convictions, attitude and response in prison and reports from prison staff and social work reports. Hannah McLaughlan's rapist was sentenced to nine-and-a-half years in prison in 2023. Hannah said rapists who don't show remorse and accountability should not get parole. She said: \"We need that validation - that you (the rapist) are actually taking accountability for what you did to us.\" Hannah has urged people in power to listen to survivors. Both women have teamed up to call for three changes: Kate Wallace, chief executive of Victim Support Scotland, said the parole process \"is often not explained clearly, contributing to further trauma and stress\". She added that there was an opportunity \"to more clearly articulate how parole decisions are reached\". The Scottish Prison Service makes initial contact with victims who sign up to the Victim Notification Scheme. A spokesperson said they will be provided with \"clear information at different stages of the offender's sentence and given an opportunity to provide representations\". The Parole Board for Scotland's chairman John Watt told BBC Scotland News that, when it comes to clearer information for victims, the organisation should always be looking to improve. He said the board has been trying for a number of years to develop systems which will provide information and assistance to victims. \"It still comes as a surprise to victims when the parole hearing comes around and it can be a real shock…I can't begin to imagine how they must feel,\" he said. \"There must be a way of smoothing that process by speaking to victims as early as we can, if they want it, to explain broadly what a sentence means, broadly when the prisoner will be considered for parole and the kind of things we'll take into account.\" Mr Watt said a law change would be required to give victims an automatic right to attend oral hearings although the vast majority of requests are approved. On the subject of prisoners who deny guilt, he said panels do take that into account but how much weight they apply to it depends on the other evidence in the case and \"where that denial sits in the jigsaw puzzle of evidence\". Justice Secretary Angela Constance said her thoughts remained with Ellie and Hannah and the Scottish government would take their views seriously. She said: \"There have been a number of victim-centred reforms to the parole process implemented in recent years and I am always open to building on those to improve the experience of victims. The parole board, which is independent of ministers, has a critical leadership role in driving improvement in transparency and understanding of the parole proces\" She added that in October the Scottish government announced proposed changes to the Victim Notification Scheme so victims can receive improved support, advice and information.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp8gxk7r9o","published_time":"2024-12-16T06:21:48.982233Z","author_name":"Katie Hunter","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fc9d/live/d684bac0-b95b-11ef-a5e4-5d8017b04164.jpg.webp"],"source":"bbc","category":"World","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-16T16:51:48.982Z"}}
{"_id":{"$oid":"67600d58c3f742fb3373bb29"},"title_or":"Bronze Age massacre victims likely cannibalised","description_or":"Scientists have uncovered the aftermath of an \"exceptionally violent\" attack about 4,000 years ago in Somerset when at least 37 people appear to have been butchered and likely eaten. It is the largest case of violence between humans identified in early Bronze Age England, which had been considered a peaceful time. The victims' bones were found by cavers in the 1970s. Experts believe they were thrown into a 15m shaft by the prehistoric attackers. The massacre was probably driven by a furious \"desire for revenge\" and its effects likely \"echoed through generations\", says Professor Rick Schulting at Oxford university. He says the victims may have been eaten as a ritual to \"dehumanise\" them and to send a message by \"insulting the remains\". Around 3,000 fragments of bones found at a cave system called Charterhouse Warren in the Mendip Hills, Somerset, were analysed by a team of archaeologists.  They believe that at least 37 people died, including men, woman and children. Teenagers and older children made up about half of the victims. Villages in early Bronze Age Britain were made up of around 50 to 100 people, so the experts think this could have equated to wiping-out almost one entire community. The Bronze Age in Britain lasted from about 2500–2000 BC until 800BC, and was a time when bronze replaced stone for making tools and weapons. People developed new agricultural methods, creating large and permanent farms. In the newly-identified attack there was no evidence of a fight back, suggesting the victims were taken by surprise. Scrape and cut marks on the bones indicate that the attackers systematically dismembered their victims using stone tools and likely consumed them. \"If we saw these marks on animal bones, we'd have no question that they were butchered,\" says Prof Schulting. The scientists do not believe the attackers ate the remains out of hunger because the fragments were found alongside animal bones, indicating there was sufficient food. The extensive dismembering of the bodies is the first documented case for this era.  There is limited evidence that tension in this era was caused by a fight over resources. That led the experts to suspect this violence was caused by a huge breakdown in relationships. \"This was something exceptional. This level of almost erasing the person, literally chopping them into pieces, seems like something you would only do if fuelled by anger, fear and resentment,\" Prof Schulting suggests. One theory was that someone did \"something horrible that justified this in the eyes of those doing it\", he says. \"This is not a homicidal maniac. This is a community of people that came together to do this to another community,\" Prof Schulting adds. He says perhaps a culture of honour led to the attack. \"If you felt wronged, it was ultimately your responsibility to do something about it. It's not like you could go to the magistrate and ask for something to be done,\" Prof Schulting says. He suggests that this looks like a case where \"things cycled out of control and normal checks and balances failed.\" That could be because of one particularly antagonistic person who didn't \"let things rest\" or \"had their own agenda\". \"If you have those kinds of people on two sides of a conflict, it starts to spiral out of control,\" he suggests. Experts have usually believed that early Bronze Age England was not particularly violent because very limited signs of conflict have been found. There is no evidence of weapons like swords or of fortifications that would suggest communities needed to protect themselves.  Before this discovery, only about 10 victims of violent attacks had been found from the period, Prof Schulting says. The scientists said they do not believe this would have been a one-off attack because \"there would have been repercussions\". \"But at some point calmer heads probably prevailed and people got on with their lives and some sense of normality returned,\" Prof Schulting suggests. He cautions that the attack should not be seen as a sign that the past was \"particularly savage and bloody\" or that \"we're beyond all of that now.\" \"I hope it gives us insights into human nature that extend beyond just the Bronze Age,\" he adds. The research is published in the academic journal Antiquity.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crl3jn3elz3o","published_time":"2024-12-16T00:21:50.579386Z","author_name":"Georgina Rannard","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/62b2/live/825434c0-b97a-11ef-a2ca-e99d0c9a24e3.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4767/live/fdde7ce0-b97a-11ef-a2ca-e99d0c9a24e3.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4ec1/live/16147bf0-b978-11ef-aff0-072ce821b6ab.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6679/live/c67cec90-b976-11ef-aff0-072ce821b6ab.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/117b/live/af42eba0-b977-11ef-aff0-072ce821b6ab.jpg.webp"],"source":"bbc","category":"World","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-16T16:51:50.579Z"}}
{"_id":{"$oid":"67600d58c3f742fb3373bb2a"},"title_or":"Social media given 'last chance' to tackle illegal posts","description_or":"Online platforms must begin assessing whether their services expose users to illegal material by 16 March 2025 or face financial punishments as the Online Safety Act (OSA) begins taking effect. Ofcom, the regulator enforcing the UK's internet safety law, published its final codes of practice for how firms should deal with illegal online content on Monday. Platforms have three months to carry out risk assessments identifying potential harms on their services or they could be fined up to 10% of their global turnover. Ofcom head Dame Melanie Dawes told BBC News this was the \"last chance\" for industry to make changes. \"If they don't start to seriously change the way they operate their services, then I think those demands for things like bans for children on social media are going to get more and more vigorous,\" she said. \"I'm asking the industry now to get moving, and if they don't they will be hearing from us with enforcement action from March.\" Under Ofcom's codes, platforms will need to identify if, where and how illegal content might appear on their services and ways they will stop it reaching users According to the OSA, this includes content relating to child sexual abuse material (CSAM), controlling or coercive behaviour, extreme sexual violence, promoting or facilitating suicide and self-harm. But critics say the Act fails to tackle a wide range of harms for children. Andy Burrows, head of the Molly Rose Foundation, said the organisation was \"astonished and disappointed\" by a lack of specific, targeted measures for platforms on dealing with suicide and self-harm material in Ofcom's guidance. \"Robust regulation remains the best way to tackle illegal content, but it simply isn't acceptable for the regulator to take a gradualist approach to immediate threats to life,\" he said. The OSA became law in October 2023, following years of wrangling by politicians over its detail and scope, and campaigning by people concerned over the impact of social media on young people. Ofcom began consulting on its illegal content codes that November, and says it has now \"strengthened\" its guidance for tech firms in several areas. Ofcom says its codes include greater clarity around requirements to take down intimate image abuse content, and more guidance on how to identify and remove material related to women being coerced into sex work. It also includes child safety features such as ensuring that social media platforms stop suggesting people befriend children's accounts and warnings about risks of sharing personal information. Certain platforms must also use a technology called hash-matching to detect child sexual abuse material (CSAM) - a requirement that now applies to smaller file hosting and storage sites. Hash matching is where media is given a unique digital signature which can be checked against hashes belonging to known content - in this case, databases of known CSAM. Many large tech firms have already brought in safety measures for teenage users and controls to give parents more oversight of their social media activity in a bid to tackle dangers for teens and pre-empt regulations. For instance, on Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, users under the age of 18 cannot be discovered in search or messaged by accounts they do not follow. In October, Instagram also started blocking some screenshots in direct messages to try and combat sextortion attempts - which experts have warned are on the rise, often targeting young men. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said Ofcom's publication of its codes was a \"significant step\" towards the government's aim of making the internet safer for people in the UK. \"These laws mark a fundamental reset in society's expectations of technology companies,\" he said.  \"I expect them to deliver and will be watching closely to make sure they do.\" Concerns have been raised throughout the OSA's journey over its rules applying to a huge number of varied online services - with campaigners also frequently warning about the privacy implications of platform age verification requirements. And parents of children who died after exposure to illegal or harmful content have previously criticised Ofcom for moving at a \"snail's pace\". The regulator's illegal content codes will still need to be approved by parliament before they can come fully into force on 17 March. But platforms are being told now, with the presumption that the codes will have no issue passing through parliament, and firms must have measures in place to prevent users from accessing outlawed material by this date.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy83jdpgw5o","published_time":"2024-12-16T10:21:51.426423Z","author_name":"Liv McMahon","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fc0d/live/7af6fe30-bb80-11ef-b51d-3926bd0ae179.jpg.webp"],"source":"bbc","category":"World","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-16T16:51:51.427Z"}}

She made the remark while commentating for Fox Sports in Brisbane on Sunday after Bumrah got India off to a stunning start with two quick wickets.  Her comment sparked a social media backlash which noted the word's history as a racial slur.   On Monday, Guha apologised on air: \"Yesterday in commentary I used a word that can be interpreted in a number of different ways... I'd like to apologise for any offence caused.\" Guha, who is also a BBC commentator and former England cricketer, had been speaking live on air with colleagues Brett Lee and Allan Border when the controversy happened. \"Bumrah, today: five overs, 2-4. So, that's the tone, and that's what you want from the ex-skipper,\" Lee said. Guha responded: \"Well, he's the MVP, isn't he? [The] most valuable primate, Jasprit Bumrah. He is the one that's going to do all the talking for India, and why so much focus was on him in the build-up to this Test match, and whether he would be fit.\" In her apology on Monday, she said: \"I set myself really high standards when it comes to empathy and respect for others and if you listen to the full transcript, I only meant the highest praise for one of India's greatest players and someone that I admire greatly as well,\" she said. She said she had been \"trying to frame the enormity of his achievements and I have chosen the wrong word and for that I am deeply sorry\". \"As someone who is also of South Asian heritage, I hope people would recognise there was no other intention or malice there,\" she said. Former India coach Ravi Shastri, a fellow Fox Sports commentator, commended her for the apology and urged India to \"move on\".  \"People are entitled to make mistakes. We are all human. To own up and say, 'I'm sorry' … it takes courage. She's done it. \"As far as the Indian team, there is a Test on and they want to focus on the game,\" he said. Bumrah continued his achievements on Monday, taking his sixth wicket of the innings. Allegations of racism are not unheard of in international cricket, while an independent report into cricket published last year found that racism, sexism, classism and elitism were \"widespread\" in the English and Welsh game.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn9gy7938xeo","published_time":"2024-12-16T08:21:52.218670Z","author_name":"Kelly Ng","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0b4e/live/4d79c2c0-bb5e-11ef-9941-6df04cb58452.jpg.webp"],"source":"bbc","category":"Sports","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-16T16:51:52.219Z"}}

{"_id":{"$oid":"67600d58c3f742fb3373bb2e"},"title_or":"Stokes blow compounds England slide towards defeat","description_or":"Ben Stokes has bowled more over in this series than any other when he has been captain Third Test, Hamilton (day three of five) New Zealand 347 (Santner 76; Potts 4-90) & 453 (Williamson 156, Young 60, Mitchell 60) England 143 (Henry 4-48, Santner 3-7, O'Rourke 3-33) & 18-2 England need 640 runs to win Scorecard England's slide towards a massive defeat in the third Test against New Zealand was compounded by a concerning recurrence of Ben Stokes' hamstring injury. Stokes was in visible distress as he left the field clutching the same left hamstring he injured in August, subsequently missing four Tests. The captain was bowling his third over of the third day, midway through the afternoon session. He pulled up in the follow-through of his second delivery, went straight to the dressing room and did not return for the remainder of the New Zealand second innings. The all-rounder will have a scan overnight. Even before Stokes was injured, England were staring down the barrel as an inevitable Kane Williamson century built New Zealand's monstrous lead. After rain delayed play by two and a half hours, Williamson moved to 156. He added 107 with Rachin Ravindra, who made 44, and another 92 with Daryl Mitchell, who helped himself to 60. When New Zealand were finally bowled out for 453, England's target was a world-record and improbable 658. England were left six overs to bat, in which time Ben Duckett played an awful hack to drag on off the retiring Tim Southee and Zak Crawley was lbw to his tormentor Matt Henry. The tourists will resume on 18-2 when play gets under way at the earlier time of 10:30 (21:30 GMT Monday) on day four. Dry weather is forecast for days four and five, giving New Zealand plenty of time to salvage a consolation victory from a series England have already won. For England, the bigger worry is Stokes' fitness. England 'may need to manage Stokes' bowling' This is a devastating blow for Stokes, whose progress from left-knee surgery at the end of last year has now been hit by two hamstring injuries in the space of five months. The first, sustained playing for Northern Superchargers in The Hundred, ruled him out of the home series against Sri Lanka and first Test in Pakistan. Stokes later admitted the mental toll the battle to get fit in Pakistan took on him, made worse by a break-in at his home while he was away. The captain has looked near to his best in New Zealand, the country of his birth, both as a leader and a player. The 33-year-old had been able to play a full role as a fourth seamer, but it is the repeat injury after such a bowling workload that is the cause for alarm. The 23 overs he bowled on the first day of this Test are the most he has bowled in a single day, his 36.2 overs in the match his most since June 2022 and the 66.1 overs in the series his most as captain. Stokes pulled up with a back problem during the first Test in Christchurch, though was able to stay on the field. His immediate reaction here was an instant indication of the severity of the issue. As Ravindra hoiked to mid-on, Stokes hobbled off, covering his face as he left. Ollie Pope, already standing-in as wicketkeeper, took over as captain. Stokes had treatment and will be assessed further before England make a decision on whether he bats in the second innings. His spell with MI Cape Town in the SA T20 in January will surely be cancelled and any slim prospect of a return to the England one-day team for the Champions Trophy is over. More important are the questions over his long-term prospects as a Test bowler. Kane Williamson now has 33 Test centuries When New Zealand resumed on 136-3, leading by 340, England's prospects were already bleak and Williamson mercilessly removed any semblance of hope. On his home ground, Williamson racked up his seventh century and nudged his average at Seddon Park to 94.94. From 50 overnight, he was watchful and correct, mainly waiting for England to drop short in order to cut to the square boundary. On 73, Williamson survived the tightest lbw shout from Brydon Carse and on 80 miscued Shoaib Bashir over Carse at mid-wicket. On 86, a pull at a Stokes bouncer was parried by Pope flying down the leg side. It would have been a magnificent catch. When Stokes was injured he was replaced in the attack by left-arm spinner Jacob Bethell, whom Williamson hit for six over long-on to go to his 33rd Test hundred. The action simply became about how many runs New Zealand wanted to amass. Williamson seemed nailed for a double, only to sweep Bashir to sub fielder Rehan Ahmed at deep square leg. Mitchell holed out to long-off to become Bethell's first Test wicket. The futility of New Zealand continuing to grow their lead bordered on farce. England spared their seamers and Harry Brook bowled with the second new ball. The crowd chanted for Southee and got their wish after Mitchell Santner was out for 49, including five sixes. England gave Southee his second guard of honour of the match, his quest to add to his 98 career sixes ended by lofting Bethell to long-on. Next ball, Bethell bowled Henry to end with 3-72. Zak Crawley overturned being given out leg before to Henry from the fifth ball of the innings, before Duckett's ridiculous charge at Southee. There was still time for Henry to get Crawley for the sixth time in six innings in the series. Crawley ends with a series average of 8.66 – no England opener has ever batted as much in a single series and ended with a lower average.

The 39-year-old retired earlier this year having won a record 35 Tour de France stages - the last coming in Saint Vulbas in July. Cavendish, who is from the Isle of Man, won 165 professional races and rounded off a stellar career with victory at the Tour de France Criterium in Singapore in November. He will be presented with his award during the 2024 BBC Sports Personality of the Year show on Tuesday. \"It's such an amazing feeling - what an honour,\" said Cavendish. \"I've been riding for 20 years and I've done everything I can so to be awarded this is something very, very special. \"I'm very fortunate I've done everything I wanted to do, and proud that's more than many other people have done as well. I always dreamed of having my name alongside those greats I grew up watching.\" Cavendish's roll of honour includes the road world title in 2011, 17 stages of the Giro d'Italia and three of the Vuelta a Espana. On the track, he won omnium silver at the 2016 Olympics and was a three-time madison world champion. How misfit Cavendish changed the face of cycling All you need to know about Sports Personality of the Year 2024 Sports Personality of the Year shortlist announced Cavendish's journey has not been straightforward. Early in his career, he showed promise as a BMX and mountain bike rider before becoming part of a British Cycling set-up that went on to dominate the track events at the 2008 and 2012 Olympics. His pro career on the road began in 2005 in a feeder team for T-Mobile, and he won his first Tour stage in 2008 for Team Columbia. But from 2017 he was struck by injury, illness and depression - and the Briton feared his career could be over when he failed to win a race during 2019 and 2020. A remarkable turnaround brought four more Tour stage wins - and the overall green jersey - in 2021 during a second spell with the Belgian Quick Step team. Once again, a tumultuous year followed, and Cavendish and his family were the victims of a violent robbery at their home in 2021. He did not secure a place at the 2022 Tour and his future in cycling again looked in doubt before Astana-Qazaqstan pounced at the last minute for 2023. They took Cavendish to a 14th - and what should have been final - Tour but a horror crash in which he sustained a broken collarbone abruptly ended his race and left him determined not to allow that to be his final farewell. And so it was that in Saint Vulbas earlier this year, he powered to the line in trademark fashion to beat the long-standing record set by Belgian great Eddy Merckx. The 'Manx Missile' ended his career fittingly with victory in Singapore in November - a month after he was knighted. Cavendish was the BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2011. In 2023, the Lifetime Achievement award was presented to Liverpool, Celtic and Scotland football legend Sir Kenny Dalglish.

Martin, 38, guided the Saints to promotion last year in his first season in charge, beating Leeds United in the play-off final at Wembley. But the loss against Spurs was Southampton's 13th in the league this campaign from 16 games. Their only win this season was against Everton in November, while the St Mary's club have scored a league-low 11 goals. \"Going into the start of the season, we all knew the challenges that we would face this year as we readjusted to life in the top flight, competing in the best and most competitive league in the world,\" said a Southampton statement. \"However, the reality of our situation is clear. The board have supported Russell and his staff and been open and transparent regarding our expectations.  \"We have all been on the same page in recognising the urgency of needing results to improve. \"We would like to take this opportunity to thank Russell and his staff for all the hard work and dedication they have given the club on and off the pitch over the last 18 months.  \"Everyone connected with Southampton FC will always have fantastic memories of last season, especially the play-off final win in May.\" Southampton Under-21s manager Simon Rusk will take interim charge of the senior side and his first game will be a Carabao Cup quarter-final at home to Premier League leaders Liverpool on Wednesday.  Martin's dismissal comes on the same day as fellow top-flight strugglers Wolves decided to sack manager Gary O'Neil. What do you make of the decision to sack Martin? This video can not be played 'Football is ruthless' - Why have Southampton sacked Martin? Southampton were 5-0 down to Tottenham before half-time and frustration from some of the home fans was directed at both Martin and club owners Sport Republic. Despite making nine permanent signings in the summer, Saints' squad has been exposed in the Premier League, with the lack of goals and a porous defence. \"This is a very precarious job,\" said Martin after the game. \"I can't sit here after losing 5-0, being bottom of the table and pretend I'm feeling confident about my job. \"I've no choice but to work and to fight. That's all I've done in this job and I'll continue to do that until I am told otherwise.\" No team has ever had five points or fewer at this stage of a Premier League campaign and avoided relegation. Martin has refused to compromise on his possession-based passing principles but it has not worked as:  Only four teams have had a worse goal difference after 16 Premier League matches of a campaign than Southampton's -25 Southampton have had more errors leading to goals than anyone else this season (10) and more mistakes leading to shots than any other side (26) Saints have faced 108 shots on target this season - the most in the Premier League Southampton's next league game will be a trip to Fulham before they host West Ham and travel to Crystal Palace before the end of the year.  \"They have imploded a lot,\" BBC Sport pundit Danny Murphy told Match of the Day 2. \"Football is ruthless and when you are at the bottom and the hierarchy and supporters want to stay up, you are going to get moved on. Someone else is going to come in and have a hell of a job but I think it's too late.\" He added: \"You have to be more flexible than he [Martin] was. Ultimately, in the Premier League if your recruitment isn't very good and you don't have a lot of Premier League experience, you are going to struggle and that is what happened.\" Southampton fans held up a banner at the game against Spurs which read: \"RM: Get out of our club!\" \"It is harsh seeing the Russell Martin banner. Not long ago he got them up and was a hero,\" former Republic of Ireland keeper Shay Given told MOTD2. \"The Premier League is a big step up from the Championship.\" Nick Mashiter, BBC Sport football reporter Martin was under pressure from the start of the season at Southampton with the club unable to get up to speed with the Premier League quickly enough. There is little shying away from the criticism he has received for his possession-based style. Southampton have given away too many soft goals, have failed to adapt on the pitch and their position speaks for itself but it has not been for the lack of trying or coaching. Despite the struggles, the Southampton ownership have been supportive of the management this season. They had been present around the Saints' Staplewood training ground often, but after the defeat to Spurs, ultimately decided they had no alternative.

{"_id":{"$oid":"67600d58c3f742fb3373bb31"},"title_or":"'I am not good enough' - Guardiola faces daunting and major rebuild","description_or":"This video can not be played 'I am not good enough' - Guardiola says he must find a 'solution' after derby loss Pep Guardiola says his sleep has suffered during Manchester City's deepening crisis, so he will not be helped by a nightmarish conclusion to one of the most stunning defeats of his long reign. Guardiola looked agitated, animated and on edge even after City led the Manchester derby through Josko Gvardiol's 36th-minute header, his reaction to the goal one of almost disdain that it came via a deflected cross as opposed to in his purist style. He sat alone with his eyes closed sipping from a water bottle before the resumption of the second half, then was denied even the respite of victory when Manchester United gave this largely dismal derby a dramatic conclusion it barely deserved with a remarkable late comeback. First, with 88 minutes on the clock, Matheus Nunes presented Amad Diallo with the ball before compounding his error by flattening the forward as he made an attempt to recover his mistake. Bruno Fernandes completed the formalities from the penalty spot. Worse was to come two minutes later when Lisandro Martinez's routine long ball caught City's defence inexplicably statuesque. Goalkeeper Ederson's positioning was awry, allowing the lively Diallo to pounce from an acute angle to leave Guardiola and his players stunned. It was the latest into any game, 88 minutes, that reigning Premier League champions had led then lost. It was also the first time City had lost a game they were leading so late on. And in a sign of City's previous excellence that is now being challenged, they have only lost four of 105 Premier League home games under Guardiola in which they have been ahead at half-time, winning 94 and drawing seven. Guardiola delivered a brutal self-analysis as he told Match of the Day: \"I am not good enough. I am the boss. I am the manager. I have to find solutions and so far I haven't. That's the reality. \"Not much else to say. No defence. Manchester United were incredibly persistent. We have not lost eight games in two seasons. We can't defend that.\" Diallo's derby - how Amad made the difference for Man Utd 'Amorim willing to meet Rashford drift head on' Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola in despair during the derby defeat to Manchester United Guardiola suggested the serious renewal will wait until the summer but the red flags have been appearing for weeks in the sudden and shocking decline of a team that has lost the aura of invincibility that left many opponents beaten before kick-off in previous years. He has had stated City must \"survive\" this season - whatever qualifies as survival for a club of such rich ambition - but the quest for a record fifth successive Premier League title is surely over as they lie nine points behind leaders Liverpool having played a game more.  Their Champions League aspirations are also in jeopardy after another loss, this time against Juventus in Turin. City's squad has been allowed to grow too old together. The insatiable thirst for success seems to have gone, the scales of superiority have fallen away and opponents now sense vulnerability right until the final whistle, as United did here. The manner in which United were able, and felt able, to snatch this victory drove right to the heart of how City, and Guardiola, are allowing opponents to prey on their downfall. Guardiola has every reason to cite injuries, most significantly to Rodri and also John Stones as well as others, but this cannot be used an excuse for such a dramatic decline in standards, allied to the appearance of a soft underbelly that is so easily exploited. And City's rebuild will not be a quick fix. With every performance, every defeat, the scale of what lies in front of Guardiola becomes more obvious - and daunting. Manchester City's fans did their best to reassure Guardiola of their faith in him with a giant Barcelona-inspired banner draped from the stands before kick-off emblazoned with his image reading \"Més que un entrenador\" - \"More Than A Coach\". And Guardiola will now need to be more than a coach than at any time in his career. He will have the finances but it will be done with City's challengers also strengthening. Kevin de Bruyne, 34 in June, lasted 68 minutes here before he was substituted. Age and injuries are catching up with one of the greatest players of the Premier League era and he is unlikely to be at City next season. Mateo Kovacic, who replaced De Bruyne, is also 31 in May. Kyle Walker, 34, is being increasingly exposed. His most notable contribution here was an embarrassing collapse to the ground after the mildest head-to-head collision with Rasmus Hojlund. Ilkay Gundogan, another 34-year-old and a previous pillar of Guardiola's great successes, no longer has the legs or energy to exert influence. This looks increasingly like a season too far following his return from Barcelona. Flaws are also being exposed elsewhere, with previously reliable performers failing to hit previous standards. Phil Foden scored 27 goals and had 12 assists when he was Premier League Player of the Season last term. This year he has just three goals and two assists in 18 appearances in all competitions. He has no goals and just one assist in 11 Premier League games. Jack Grealish, who came on after 77 minutes against United, has not scored in a year for Manchester City, his last goal coming in a 2-2 draw against Crystal Palace on 16 December last year. He has, in the meantime, scored twice for England. Erling Haaland is also struggling as City lack creativity and cutting edge. He has three goals in his past 11 Premier League games after scoring 10 in his first five. And in another indication of City's impotence, and their reliance on Haaland, defender Gvardiol's goal against United was his fourth this season, making him their second highest scorer in all competitions behind the Norwegian striker, who has 18. Goalkeeper Ederson, so reliable for so long, has already been dropped once this season and did not cover himself in glory for United's winner. Guardiola, with that freshly signed two-year contract, insists he \"wants it\" as he treads on this alien territory of failure. He will be under no illusions about the size of the job in front of him as he placed his head in his hands in anguish after yet another damaging and deeply revealing defeat. City and Guardiola are in new, unforgiving territory.

{"_id":{"$oid":"67600d58c3f742fb3373bb32"},"title_or":"Six goals, 10 pens & 120 minutes of Old Firm chaos","description_or":"Celtic have lost just one game this season, defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League On a day of six goals, 11 bookings, 12 substitutions and 120 minutes of cup final bonkerdom, into penalties they went.  Chests were wheezing, legs cramping, hearts fluttering, rain falling. \"Carnage, just carnage\" as the Celtic defender Liam Scales said in the aftermath. The tension, the drama, the lost-soul demeanour of Ridvan Yilmaz as he walked back to the halfway line having had his penalty saved by Kasper Schmeichel. The sight of Jack Butland, the Rangers goalkeeper, then having to score against Schmeichel to keep his team alive in the shoot-out, which he did. Then the suspense as Daizen Maeda stood over that last kick, the big opportunity to finally put a gallant Rangers to sleep, which he took. Unerringly. Maeda carries himself like a man who laughs in the face of pressure, who pokes a finger in the eye of stressful situations such as this. At no point did you really get a feeling that he was going to miss.  That's not being wise after the event. This was in real time. Maeda looked like he was in his element.  He was oh so cool in the final seconds of a final that for big chunks reached epic proportions. Celtic beat Rangers on penalties after epic More Celtic reaction & have your say What are they saying in the Rangers camp? Rangers looked stunned and sickened, as well they might. Of all the blows that Celtic have inflicted on them in recent seasons, this has to be the most painful. Worse, surely, than last season's Scottish Cup final, secured at the death by Adam Idah. That had been a scrap. On that day, Rangers hadn't delivered anything like the goals and moments they came up with on Sunday. More grievous than the Scottish Cup semi-final in April 2023 won by Jota? For sure.  More sickening in its own way than the 3-0s and 4-0s visited upon them in the time of Ange Postecoglou and earlier this season? You have to think so. Those were heavy beatings with no excruciating what-might-have-beens attached. Regret was the difference.  At 1-0 at Hampden on Sunday, and with Celtic a rattled version of their usual selves, Rangers broke free and had a four-on-one. Hamza Igamane was in control of the ball with men running free outside him. Had he made the right decision, it was a one-on-one with Schmeichel from point-blank range. He didn't. He made a bad call. Sliding doors. A possible 2-0 went begging. There was more. Three minutes into the first period of extra time, Scales tugged Vaclav Cerny so microscopically close to the penalty box that Philippe Clement complained later about a lack of VAR intervention. He had a point.  Rangers folk may feel tortured by those what-if moments as much as the missed penalty much later on. As Celtic lifted the trophy, most Rangers fans had already exited, presumably having had a bellyful of disappointment for one day. Only Butland and Cyriel Dessers took it in from the touchline. Suckers for punishment, perhaps. This video can not be played Clement's phone 'overloaded with penalty' incident Rangers had a checklist of things that they had to get right to make a proper final of this and one by one they ticked them off. Score first - they did it having not done it in their previous six games against Celtic.  It was their first goal against Rodgers' team in more than four hours of football, the first time they were ahead against Celtic in more than nine hours. What else was on their must-do sheet?  Shut down the wounding influence of McGregor - they did that.  Show ruthlessness in front of goal - yes.  Silence Kyogo Furuahshi - done.  Bring the intensity and work rate and aggression and character of Thursday against Tottenham to Hampden - achieved, with bells and whistles attached. Tick, tick, tick. Character? They had it in spades.  When Greg Taylor, villain turned hero, and then Maeda transformed a 0-1 into a 2-1, it looked like Celtic had finally got hold of things. We thought we knew which way this was heading at that point, but we hadn't a clue. Nicolas Raskin and Mohamed Diomande had put in towering performances in hustling and harrying and living in the face of a Celtic midfield that has brought ruination to their door so often - and it was Diomande who levelled. With 15 minutes of normal time left, it was 2-2. With three minutes left, it was 3-2 Celtic.  Twenty one seconds after the restart it was 3-3, Danilo's header extending the final and hammering home the point that Rangers have found something of late, a bit of steel and a bit of belief. But no trophy to go with it. This video can not be played 'Most important thing is being on the podium at the end' - Rodgers Incredibly, McGregor has never lost a cup final, but \"it was mighty close today,\" he said. The captain was as relieved as he was honest.  \"The performance wasn't great, so we had to grind it out. We had to hold our nerve. Even when you're not perfect, you can still win. Dig in. Find something extra.\" Pyro, predictably, reappeared and kick-off was delayed, two more fingers being raised by the ultras to their own clubs and to the footballing authorities who practically begged them to behave. More charges pending from the SPFL? Let's see. When the action began, it was toe-to-toe. Rangers were physical and uncompromising.  Amid the maelstrom, Taylor lost his head, played a square ball that was a bad idea and also poorly executed in any event and that was the catalyst for the opener. The omens were good for Rangers. Only four teams who have scored first in the last 49 League Cup finals have failed to win the trophy. But stats don't take into account Celtic's steepling self belief. They were in trouble - no space, no control, not many chances - but they found their way out of it. Celtic's mental strength is a thing of wonder. They were nowhere near their best and yet they have another title to their name. The shoot-out came and with it came memories of Rangers' in the Europa League denouement in Seville against Eintracht Frankfurt. Aaron Ramsey, then. Yilmaz now. Schmeichel did his thing. There was gamesmanship in the way he tried to put off some Rangers penalty takers. There were some mocking words in reply from Ianis Hagi after he buried his kick past the Dane.   Ultimately, this odyssey came down to Yilmaz versus Schmeichel and Maeda versus Butland. Celtic won, by a whisker or by a mile, it doesn't really matter.  A different kind of victory from before, but the same feelgood in one dressing room and presumably the same silence and despair in the other.

{"_id":{"$oid":"676030d0c3f742fb3373bb34"},"title_or":"Calls for Archbishop of York to resign over Church failings in sex abuse case","description_or":"The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell is facing calls to resign over his handling of a sexual abuse case, days before he takes temporary charge of the Church of England. As Bishop of Chelmsford, Mr Cottrell let priest David Tudor remain in post in the diocese despite knowing he had been barred by the Church from being alone with children and had paid compensation to a sexual abuse victim, a BBC investigation reveals. Tudor was only banned from ministry two months ago - after he admitted historical sex abuse allegations relating to two girls.  Since this article was first published, Mr Cottrell has responded saying he is \"deeply sorry\" that action could not be taken earlier, but that was the situation he inherited.  However, the Bishop of Newcastle the Rt Rev Helen-Ann Hartley has said Mr Cottrell could have done more and should resign as archbishop. \"It completely undermines his credibility that this case was not acted on,\" she told BBC File on 4 Investigates. \"How can you have the moral and ethical authority to lead an institution with that?\" A woman who was paid £10,000 compensation by Tudor over claims he sexually abused her as a child says Mr Cottrell's failure to act when he was told about the payment means he should \"leave the Church\". \"I feel like he [Stephen Cottrell] has spat in my face,\" says Jessica (not her real name). The calls for Archbishop Cottrell to resign come at a time of turmoil in the Church of England following a damning report into how it covered up prolific abuse by the barrister John Smyth. The report led to the resignation of the Church's most senior figure, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby. Mr Cottrell will take over his role temporarily for a few months in the New Year. The BBC can reveal that Mr Welby and a former Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, were also involved in the Tudor case - Mr Welby in 2018 and Lord Carey in 1993. David Tudor did not respond to the BBC's questions. At least seven women say they were abused by Tudor. One received six-figure compensation from the Church in 2019.  David McClenaghan, a partner at Bolt Burdon Kemp solicitors who brought the claim on behalf of the woman and who has supported other survivors of clerical abuse says \"one of the most surprising aspects of this case was that they suspended him on full pay and over a period of time,  funded his accommodation and lifestyle.\" Tudor worked for the Church of England for over 46 years, in London, Surrey and Essex, rising from curate to honorary canon. He gained a reputation for filling churches with his charismatic preaching. He was an area dean on Canvey Island in Essex in 2010, when Stephen Cottrell became Bishop of Chelmsford - a position Mr Cottrell held for 10 years before becoming Archbishop of York. During his first week in office, Mr Cottrell was fully briefed on the \"longstanding safeguarding concerns\" raised about Tudor, a spokesperson for the Archbishop said. Mr Cottrell would have been told: Mr Cottrell's office told the BBC that for much of his time as Bishop of Chelmsford he had been unable to take any disciplinary action because there were no complaints that hadn't already been dealt with. It was not until 2019, when a fresh complaint was made against Tudor leading to a suspension, that there was \"an opportunity to remove the risk\", said a spokesperson. Bishop Hartley, told File on 4 Investigates that had not been an adequate response because \"any action that could have been taken\" by Mr Cottrell \"should have been vastly stronger than simply to try and manage a risk, particularly if the priest in question is already banned from working with children or entering schools\". In a statement issued on Monday, Mr Cottrell says in 2019 he had \"acted immediately\" suspending David Tudor from all ministry pending the subsequent tribunal in which he was prohibited from ministry for life. While Mr Cottrell's office maintains there were no legal grounds to act until 2019, the BBC can reveal that Mr Cottrell was told in 2012 about the £10,000 payout Tudor had made to Jessica, who says she was sexually abused by him, sometimes very violently, from the age of 11 during the 1970s when Tudor was training to be a minister. She had brought the claim after police ended an investigation without pressing charges. \"Nobody would make a payment if they haven't got something to hide,\" says Jessica. Bishop Hartley says the payout was \"completely against the principles of the institution\" that Mr Cottrell is supposed to be part of and should have led to disciplinary proceedings against the priest. The personal payment made by Tudor \"admitted no liability\" - Mr Cottrell's office told the BBC - adding that the then-Bishop of Chelmsford had been guided by \"legal advice\" that no further action could be taken. To compound the hurt felt by those who say they were abused as children by Tudor, three years after making his compensation payment, Tudor became an honorary canon of Chelmsford Cathedral. Such an appointment was \"just horrendous\" says Jessica. David Tudor's elevation to honorary canon is something Stephen Cottrell \"regrets\", says his office, but it was \"not a promotion and not a personal reward\". \"It happened because of a change in Church policy during the bishop's time in office, meaning area deans were automatically made honorary canons.\" But that is \"ludicrous\" says Bishop of Newcastle Helen-Ann Hartley and \"simply not good enough\". \"You are absolutely uplifting somebody's ministry as an example and a model of good and best practice, and you're celebrating that actually by making them an honorary canon.\" In his statement after this article was first published, Mr Cottrell said it was \"extremely disappointing\" that it was being reported \"as if it was an abuser being ignored or even protected\".  \"Actually, nothing could be further from the truth,\" he said. Rt Rev Hartley has been a lone voice in the upper echelons of the Church of England, criticising the institution's failure to deal with abuse and to listen to victims. Last month, she became the only senior serving cleric to call for Justin Welby to step down. Now, she says, Stephen Cottrell should follow. The BBC's investigation into the David Tudor case also reveals roles played by others at the very top of the Church of England over several decades - including former Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey. Debbie (not her real name) says between the ages of 13 and 15 she was sexually abused by Tudor when he was a vicar and school chaplain in Redhill, Surrey. She was one of the three girls in his second trial in 1988. Tudor was found guilty, but the conviction was later quashed. It has had \"a huge effect\" on Debbie's life, she says, leaving her with complex post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which she says has been made worse by the Church's handling of the case since. \"It's absolutely disgusting that they supported him, that they welcomed him back into the Church,\" she says. Tudor's return to the priesthood was assisted by then-Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey. In 1993, the archbishop - now Lord Carey - agreed that Tudor could come back under supervision the following year.  This was done \"with some trepidation\", the Church of England told the BBC. Leaked documents seen by File on 4 Investigates also show that Lord Carey agreed, in 1996, to remove the priest's name from a centrally-held record of clergy who had been subject to disciplinary proceedings. Lord Carey said he does not remember David Tudor's name. The Church of England said the request was made by the then-Bishop of Southwark Roy Williamson, who died in 2019, and Lord Carey had agreed to it. \"We recognise these procedures were neither sufficient nor survivor-focussed, and that very different decisions would have been made today,\" Southwark diocese told the BBC. \"The decision not to impose a lifetime ban on David Tudor seems absolutely inexcusable in today's context and would not have been made today.\" The Tudor case also came across the desk of the current Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby in 2018, when Rev Jenny Penn wrote to his office questioning why the priest was still in post. She had been a member of a \"core group\" of Church safeguarding advisers, and national and local clergy, asked to look into Tudor because another of his alleged victims involved in the 1988 trials had issued a claim for compensation - this time from the Church, rather than Tudor personally. The woman would later win a six-figure Church payout and an apology. Archbishop Welby had recently told all clergy that it wasn't enough to say sorry about past abuse - and that they should \"take action that demonstrates clearly that we have learnt the lessons\". In her letter to him, Rev Penn said she was \"struggling with the disconnect between the words and the practice\". She received a response saying the matter had been reviewed. Rev Penn wrote again, and was again told \"the matters raised have been dealt with\".  She says she was \"fobbed off\". \"To me it was quite clear cut that this person shouldn't be in post but [Mr Welby's office] couldn't provide a satisfactory answer as to why he was.\" The Church of England told the BBC Archbishop Welby \"took seriously the correspondence from this cleric about David Tudor's permission to officiate\" and referred her concerns to the Bishop at Lambeth who was responsible for safeguarding. A reply to a third letter from Rev Penn to Mr Welby's office came from the Bishop of Lambeth's provincial safeguarding adviser and suggested matters raised had been dealt with. Rev Penn alerted the BBC to the Tudor case after reading our story about the Church paying off a Blackburn Cathedral priest assessed as a potential risk to children. \"I was shocked once more, and angry, that similar things had happened in another place. Old sins cast very long shadows,\" she says. Stephen Cottrell's spokesperson said the Archbishop of York \"completely shares and understands the hurt and frustrations that surround this case, which were frustrations and anxieties that he lived with every day he was in office\". The Church of England said the BBC File on 4 investigation \"reveals a catalogue of past safeguarding decisions, that allowed someone considered a risk in the 1980s to return to ministry in the 1990s\".  \"This should never have happened,\" it added. Mr Cottrell, in his latest statement, said the Church \"now needs independent scrutiny of safeguarding\".  \"I have publicly supported this for many years,\" he said. \"I pledge myself to do what I can to achieve it.\" Among Tudor's victims, there is relief that he is no longer in a position of power after he admitted sexual misconduct at a Church tribunal in October this year and was banned for life from ministry. \"He should never have been let back into the Church in the first place,\" says Jessica. Debbie had to move away from her hometown \"to a life where nobody knew anything about my past\". Holding back tears, she says she has \"lived with shame for 40 years\". \"It felt like he was protected. It was just so wrong.\" Additional reporting by Hayley Mortimer and Kirstie Brewer","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwydgjevx70o","published_time":"2024-12-16T12:54:54.073411Z","author_name":"Steve Swann home affairs reporter & Aleem Maqbool religion editor","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/58c7/live/0da9ee40-b974-11ef-a0f2-fd81ae5962f4.png.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bde2/live/bb6d0ba0-b976-11ef-a0f2-fd81ae5962f4.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/91ee/live/216e1aa0-b979-11ef-a2ca-e99d0c9a24e3.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/33f4/live/85803240-b978-11ef-aff0-072ce821b6ab.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/90f3/live/6d462f70-bb87-11ef-aff0-072ce821b6ab.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9e3b/live/bc6c5fd0-b89d-11ef-aff0-072ce821b6ab.jpg.webp"],"source":"bbc","category":"World","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-16T19:22:54.074Z"}}

{"_id":{"$oid":"676030d0c3f742fb3373bb36"},"title_or":"China's efforts to spy in the UK happening in plain view, says ex-Tory leader","description_or":"Former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith has said the alleged Chinese spy who was banned from entering the UK could be one of many operating \"in plain view\". The MP - who will ask an urgent question in the Commons later on China's influence - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the alleged spy could be \"the tip of the iceberg\" of those in the UK doing the same job. Known only as H6 due to a court order protecting his identity, the businessman was banned last week by the UK's semi-secret national security court, which heard he had formed an \"unusual degree of trust\" with the Duke of York. A hearing over his anonymity is set to take place at the Royal Courts of Justice at 14:00 GMT. Also on Monday, Sir Iain is expected to ask Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, if she will make a statement on the \"extent of United Front Work Department operations within the UK\". The United Front Work Department is an arm of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) which H6 is believed to have been associated with. The department is tasked with conducting influence operations. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the government was \"concerned about the challenge that China poses\". \"In relation to any discussions with Buckingham Palace there's a long-standing convention in the United Kingdom that that's never spoken about,\" he added in response to questions on H6's close ties to Prince Andrew. Other politicians have also shown concern over the reach of the United Front Work Department. Former security minister Tom Tugendhat said it showed the \"the level of threat\" posed by China to the UK. \"They're trying to change the policies of the UK and other countries around the world,\" he said.  \"They're trying to influence individuals not just in the royal family but in academia, in politics, in business and even sometimes in journalism.\"  Talking to BBC Breakfast, Tugendhat said it was a way for the CCP to \"exert influence\" within the UK. Last week, Prince Andrew said in a statement that he had \"ceased all contact\" with the Chinese businessman, with all meetings having been \"through official channels\" and \"nothing of a sensitive nature ever discussed\". H6 was invited to the prince's birthday party in 2020 and was told he could act on his behalf when dealing with potential investors in China.  In a letter found on one of H6's confiscated devices, the Chinese businessman was told by one of Prince Andrew's advisors: \"Under your guidance, we found a way to get the relevant people unnoticed in and out of the house in Windsor.\" It is not clear how H6 became close to Prince Andrew.  The alleged targeting by an alleged Chinese influence operation is the latest controversy for Prince Andrew, who is no longer a working royal. It followed scrutiny of Prince Andrew's finances this autumn, when King Charles withdrew his financial support for Prince Andrew and the costs of running Royal Lodge in Windsor, with a security bill costing several million pounds per year. Following this latest controversy there have been reports that Prince Andrew is being encouraged to keep a low profile over the Christmas season. He would usually be part of the Royal Family's Christmas Day appearance at church in Sandringham and at another Christmas Royal gathering this week and there have been suggestions he will be advised to keep out of public sight and not attract any more attention. The concerns are that Prince Andrew would become the talking point and overshadow such events, so he might be urged to voluntarily reduce his public visibility over Christmas. Prince Andrew still attends family events and ceremonial occasions, but not always the public moments. For instance, he has attended the annual Order of the Garter ceremony, without taking part in the public procession. Buckingham Palace did not comment, as Prince Andrew is no longer a working royal. The BBC has contacted Prince Andrew for a response. Alleged spy H6 was stopped and questioned by UK border police officers in November 2021, when he also surrendered a number of electronic devices including a mobile phone. In March 2023, H6 was banned entry into the UK by the then-Home Secretary Suella Braverman. He then brought his case to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, a court set up to consider appeals against decisions to ban or remove someone from the country on national security or related grounds. In the published ruling, external, the judges upheld Braverman's decision. H6 has met with many senior figures in the UK, including former Prime Ministers David Cameron and Theresa May, and Prince Andrew, to whom he was described as a \"close confidant\". But Sir Iain, who led the Conservative party 2001-2003, said the bigger issue of H6 and Prince Andrew is how China's well-funded attempts to make contact with influential individuals has been happening in \"plain view\". \"The reality is that there are many many more involved in exactly this kind of espionage that's taking place.\" H6 is not allowed to be named under an anonymity order imposed by the courts last week, which Sir Iain called ridiculous. It is believed that some MPs may use parliamentary privilege to name the Chinese businessman. Parliamentary privilege gives MPs and peers unrestricted free speech within the chambers, and allows them to name people without the fear of being dragged before the courts and sued for defamation. But others, including Jim McMahon, the minister of housing, communities and local government, believe the naming of H6 is a \"matter for the courts\".  On Monday, Sir Keir said an update on the foreign influence registration scheme will be \"coming shortly\". The scheme would require foreign lobbyists to disclose who they are in an arrangement with, what activity they have been directed to undertake, and when the arrangement was made. Asked about the scheme during a press conference in Norway, the prime minister said: \"We've been working on it from day one in government, and there will be an update coming shortly, so you'll have more information in relation to that.\" Earlier in the day, Sir Iain accused the government of abandoning the scheme because it did not want to \"upset\" China. Last month, Sir Keir emphasised the importance of a \"strong UK-China relationship\" during the first in-person meeting between a UK prime minister and Chinese President Xi Jinping since 2018. But a Home Office source told the Guardian newspaper that the previous government did not leave the scheme in a fit state to enact, which Sir Iain responded to and said there was \"nothing wrong\" with. The source added that it is still the government's intention to implement it.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg68vyz9lgo","published_time":"2024-12-16T13:04:55.083065Z","author_name":"Hafsa Khalil","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a700/live/07d94920-bb90-11ef-9eca-4b9fc4020e4b.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/df64/live/991a5e80-bb98-11ef-acfc-7396dc948a8a.jpg.webp"],"source":"bbc","category":"World","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-16T19:22:55.083Z"}}
{"_id":{"$oid":"676030d0c3f742fb3373bb37"},"title_or":"Why are more parents home-educating their children?","description_or":"\"Toby was so tremendously unhappy in school,\" says his father, Daniel. \"We were standing outside the classroom door for an hour every morning and he just didn't want to go in. \"[It reached the point where] we thought 'this doesn't work.'\" Daniel says he tried everything to settle him. Toby, who is now eight, was allowed into the classroom before other children arrived and his teacher also arranged for him to hand out books, but nothing helped. So, in May 2023 his parents decided to withdraw him from school. They are not the only ones. Government statistics released on Thursday found that a growing number of parents have withdrawn their children from mainstream education in England. An estimated 111,700 children are being home-educated, based on a census taken this year - marking a 20% rise since last year. Around 23% say their reasons for home-educating are a result of lifestyle, philosophical or preferential choices, such as religious or cultural beliefs or a rejection of an exam-based education: something that has long been the case. But 13% of families now say they made this decision because of school dissatisfaction, including a lack of support for special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) and school bullying.  In addition, 14% say it is due to their child's mental health. This is the first time the data has become mandatory, which the Department for Education says may account in part for the increase. Wendy Charles-Warner, chair of home education charity Education Otherwise, says that she is shocked by the increase in the numbers. \"It's not from parents who are wanting to home-educate,\" she argues, \"but because the school was not meeting their child's needs, and those parents should not be home-educating, because they don't want to be. Home education is not easy.\" Daniel says that this was the case for Toby. \"We had no alternative… the system is broken and does not cater for a lot of children.\" Toby has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), he explains, and requires a very flexible schedule, allowing him to spend a few minutes or a few hours on an activity, or learn \"on the move\" so he is not confined to sitting at a desk. Two of Daniel's older children, who are both autistic, are doing well at a special school but he says that Toby's educational needs aren't severe enough to qualify him for a place. \"I don't claim to be a great teacher,\" he continues. \"But I've got enough creativity and inquisitiveness to find learning opportunities as we go.\" They start the day with 20 minutes of reading. On the day we meet, they're looking at a storybook full of illustrations. Their week so far has also included gymnastics, ice-skating and forest walks.  As Daniel explains all of this, Toby is busy figuring out a puzzle in a maths workshop in a meeting room near their south London home with a group of other home-educated children. Covid lockdowns gave families a glimpse into the world of home education, as video communication technology suddenly became commonplace in many schools. Digital learning businesses and online schools sprung up too. What followed was a perfect storm: as schools re-opened, some children found the transition back to the classroom difficult, resulting in an increase in persistently absent children - around double the levels seen before the pandemic.  The latest figures from the Department for Education show that nearly one in five children missed school more than 10% of the time in the autumn and spring terms of 2023/24. Earlier this month, Sir Martyn Oliver, the chief inspector of Ofsted, England's schools regulator, said that the issue of children missing school was a \"stubborn and damaging issue\", and expressed concern over \"flexi-schooling\", where parents educate their children at home for part of the week. \"Even ten years ago [many people had] quite an idealised vision of home education involving self-directed learners who go off to Cambridge,\" explains Amber Fensham-Smith, co-director of the Open University's Children's Research Centre. \"The situation is a lot more complex now.\" \"It's plugging a gap,\" she continues. \"If your child is struggling with their mental health, you can't get an NHS referral and you want to keep them safe, what do you do? That's very different to a parent who chooses it.\" The Department for Education says it knows \"far too many children with SEND aren't having their needs met\" and recently announced £740m of funding to increase the number of places for pupils within mainstream schools. More than 1.6 million children have SEND in schools in England, an increase of 101,000 from 2023. Experts say there are various reasons for this, including greater awareness. In October, the public spending watchdog warned the special educational needs system is broken and families have lost confidence in it. Which begins to explain part of the spike in home education. What remains unclear is how effective this is as a solution. In the US, a much larger proportion of the population - an estimated 6% of children - learn at home, and studies there have found that home-educated children perform as well as, or outperform, their peers in most academic tests.  However, some experts point to the fact that participants in surveys tend to be in highly educated, middle-class families with internet access, which leaves out under-represented groups. In the UK, the Education Committee called on the government in 2021 to commission research on the life chances and social outcomes of home-educated children – but three years later, the research is still limited. One challenge with measuring success in the UK is that there is no obligation for home-educated children to follow the national curriculum or sit exams. Parents simply have a duty to provide a \"suitable education\". Earlier this month, the Education Policy Institute, an independent research organisation, warned that a lack of clarity around the law and what is required, \"potentially risks some children missing out,\" and that not knowing who or where they are \"raises questions about variation in the quality and suitability of home education.\" Others argue that there should be, for example, a minimum bar required for literacy and numeracy. But Fadoua Govaerts, who taught her five children at home and has a PhD from the University of Bath that focused on home-education experiences, believes that it's right for it to have the flexibility to be \"more holistic and inclusive\". \"Outcomes could be anything from being comfortable within their own skin, finding a new talent, become an elite athlete or actor, to gaining national qualifications or becoming an entrepreneur as a teenager,\" she says. Riyad Ozpolat has never been to school. He is 12 years old now and lives in Bristol with his parents and four siblings. His mother Weronika, a speech and language therapist, works one day a week at a school and the rest of the time home-educates three of her children. \"I've been home-schooled my whole life\", explains Riyad, as he swings on an office chair, while his 18-month old sister wanders around behind him. \"The reason I don't want to go to school is because I don't know if I'll be able to cope with sitting down.\" He sees his best friends every week at Scouts and says that he doesn't feel he's missing out on anything. Ms Ozpolat says that home-educating her children gives them a chance to focus on their passions. \"There's so much wasted time at school. I think the earlier that they can focus on their interests the better because it just means they have more expertise and extra knowledge in the thing they want to do when they're older\". However, she continues: \"As the children get older, we need to pay for them to do the GCSE exams. If they're having extra tuition and you have to pay for all of the books and resources that you need to get in order to do the exam.\" Parents who choose to home-educate take on full financial responsibility - there is no specific government support for home education. Children who are home-educated are not obliged by law to sit their GCSE exams, but if they choose to, they normally have to pay an exam board fee and an exam centre fee. Prices vary widely but for example the total cost of sitting all three GCSE maths papers at one private exam centre in London, would be £225.  Then there is the question around whether a home education always prepares people well for certain workplaces. Rachael Barrow, who is now 31, was home-educated for nine years after being bullied in school, and says she loved being taught away from the traditional classroom, but when she entered the workplace she found certain challenges. During her first job, in human resources, she struggled to adjust to having a fixed routine. \"I felt as though I was losing some of my autonomy in deciding my own schedule\", she says.  She has since changed careers and is now completing a PhD at Lancaster University. As part of this she has interviewed other adults who were previously home-educated, and found they tended to avoid corporate careers or 9-5 jobs.  Some told her that \"politics in the workplace\" was a struggle. However she is positive about the experience overall: \"I don't regret being home-educated at all\", she says. \"I think it set me up quite nicely for a career in academia.\" Some critics argue that there are gaps around regulating home-education in the UK. The current rules don't require a parent to tell the council if they are home-educating their child from the start; they only stipulate that a school must tell the local authority if a child has been de-registered. \"The UK is an absolute outlier in being the least regulated in Europe,\" says Daniel Monk, professor of law at Birkbeck, University of London. The death of 10-year-old Sara Sharif, who was removed from school by her father and stepmother to be home-educated, after her teachers raised concerns with social services, has added to the debate around strengthening regulation. Dame Rachel de Souza, the Children's Commissioner for England,  said it was \"madness\" that the law currently allowed parents to take a child out of school when concerns had already been raised. The government has set out plans to introduce a requirement for families subject to a protection plan to get council permission before removing a child from school to be home-educated. Earlier this year it also announced plans to introduce a national register in England to help account for all home-educated children. This could come into force in 2025. Dame Rachel has welcomed the decision. \"If we get proper registers, and we have local authorities taking their role seriously to engage with these families, we may find we can get lots of them back to school, which is where they need to be\", she told the Education Committee in November. But Wendy Charles-Warner argues that it is \"deeply offensive\" to parents to suggest that every child is at risk unless the local authority knows where they are. \"Home education is a big ask of parents. In most cases it's a positive move for their child, because they're acting to protect their child.\" However she acknowledges: \"Parents should not be home educating in cases where they don't want to.\" Back in south London, Toby's home education is going well - his father says he is calmer and happier - but he is all too aware that the situation is different for him than for many other families. As he puts it, they have the financial stability to be able to devote this time to educating Toby as a family. \"My wife's a doctor, we've never been financially vulnerable,\" he says. \"I'm educated, and we're very, very lucky.\" Despite all of this, he says that it has been \"bloody hard\". \"All of our kids have spent time out of school, and we have been in crisis,\" he says. \"It's not always easy but we are figuring it out\".

{"_id":{"$oid":"676030d0c3f742fb3373bb38"},"title_or":"Councils to be merged in major local government shake-up","description_or":"District councils could be abolished and more elected mayors introduced across England under new plans for a major redesign of local government.  Ministers are set to publish a paper on Monday outlining plans for mergers in areas where there are currently two tiers of local authority - smaller district and larger county councils - in a bid to streamline services. Elected metro mayors are also set to gain new powers over planning, in a bid to speed up the delivery of new housing and infrastructure. But the body representing district councils has warned the plans could spark \"turmoil\" and argued \"mega-councils\" could undermine local decision-making.  Local government in England is currently marked by a complicated patchwork of arrangements that has changed a lot in recent years. In some places, responsibility for local services is shared between county councils, which manage areas including social care and education; and district councils, which cover smaller areas and are responsible for services such as bin collections. Some areas, particularly larger towns and some cities, have \"unitary\" authorities responsible for both - while the regions surrounding big cities are increasingly covered by multi-council \"combined\" authorities with greater powers in areas such as transport policy, planning and housing. The Conservatives created 11 such areas, which have an elected \"metro\" mayor, and set a target that every part of England that wanted greater powers in some form would get a devolution deal by 2030. Despite this, around half of England's population live in an area not covered by a devolution deal. The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more housing. A paper to be published on Monday is expected to set an ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals. Streamlining local government will be presented as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, regarded by Labour as a means to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment. Elected mayors would then oversee areas representing two or more councils, and be handed more powers over things such as planning decisions and public transport. Dozens of district councils could be abolished as a result – prompting some to claim it would deprive people of genuinely localised decision-making. It would require a series of deals nationwide emulating North Yorkshire, which now has a unitary authority after eight councils were merged together last year.  This would mark a scale of reorganisation that goes beyond what Labour promised in its election manifesto, and mark arguably the biggest shake-up of local government since the 1970s. The overall timetable and route to achieving this has not been confirmed - and it is not yet clear if the government will use legal powers to force councils together, or hope to encourage them to do so through funding arrangements. Labour argues the overhaul will make local government simpler and produce savings by making the delivery of services more efficient. In a speech on Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner will vow to make devolution the \"default position of government\", and give councils the powers they need to \"drive growth and raise living standards\". The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved. Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\". She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\". A Conservative Party spokesman said Rayner's announcement is part of a plan to \"strip councils of their powers\" and to impose reorganisation from Westminster \"without local consent\". He said the party recognises more homes need to be built but says that these must be \"in the right place\". \"This new announcement will do nothing to solve that - and instead open up another front on Labour's assault on the countryside.\" The Liberal Democrats said council budgets were \"on the brink\" and without properly investing in social care more vital services would disappear.  The plans, however, have been welcomed by the County Councils Network, which says its members \"now recognise the need to embrace the benefits\" of devolution in the face of \"significant financial challenges\". Its chairman Tim Oliver said it had become clear that in many county areas, reorganisation was needed to \"unlock\" more generous funding from central government and create \"more financially sustainable\" councils. Cllr Louise Gittins, chair of the Local Government Association, said \"genuine devolution of powers and resources can play a huge role in promoting inclusive economic growth, creating jobs, and improving public services\".  She said her members were \"open to change\" but \"remain clear that local government reorganisation should be a matter for councils and local areas to decide\". Lord Houchen, the Conservative mayor of Tees Valley, welcomed the plans, including greater powers over transport and planning. However, he told the BBC they could go further by giving more control over post-16 education, to make sure local people had the right skills for jobs being created in the area.  Monday's paper is also expected to confirm plans for increased co-operation between councils in planning for transport and infrastructure projects. Upper-tier councils, including unitary authorities and current county councils, will be required to produce slimmed-down versions of the \"spatial development\" strategies used to plan for projects in big cities. Since returning to office in July, Labour has announced four devolution deals:  Greater Lincolnshire, Hull and East Yorkshire, Devon and Torbay, and Lancashire. Combined authorities, including combined county authorities in more rural areas, are more advanced in the north of England compared to the south. There has been a weaker appetite for devolution deals in swathes of the south-west and East Anglia, where minimum population requirements would also necessitate the creation of larger combined councils.

{"_id":{"$oid":"676030d0c3f742fb3373bb39"},"title_or":"Woman sentenced for hurling milkshake at Farage","description_or":"A woman who threw a McDonald's milkshake over Reform UK leader Nigel Farage during the general election campaign has been given a suspended prison sentence. Victoria Thomas Bowen hurled the drink at Farage as he left a JD Wetherspoon pub in Clacton-on-Sea on 4 June, having just launched his candidacy for the Essex constituency. Thomas Bowen has been given a 13-week jail sentence, suspended for 12 months, must pay the MP £150 compensation, complete 120 hours of unpaid work and pay £450 in court costs. Following her sentencing, Farage posted on social media: \"We now live in a country where you can assault a Member of Parliament and not go to prison.\" Thomas Bowen, 25 from Clacton, admitted assault by beating and criminal damage at a previous court hearing. She attacked Farage as he left the Moon and Starfish pub on Clacton seafront. In a statement read by prosecutors during sentencing at Westminster Magistrates' Court, Farage said he \"felt humiliated\" by the incident and was left fearing for his safety in public. He added he was \"deeply thoughtful for some time afterwards that next time it may not be a milkshake\". Farage's security officer, James Woolfenden, also had his suit damaged by the milkshake, and Thomas Bowen was also ordered to pay him £17.50 compensation for the criminal damage. Deputy senior district judge Tan Ikram told the defendant she must also pay a victim surcharge of £154 and complete 15 rehabilitation activity requirement days. Thomas Bowen, who is an OnlyFans model, had originally denied the charges and was due to go on trial at the same court in October, but changed her pleas to guilty before proceedings began. In her interview with police, she said she targeted Farage because she did not agree with his political views. Farage was standing in the constituency for the first time and won the seat, securing a large swing from the Conservatives' Giles Watling, who had a 24,702 majority in 2019. Farage secured a majority of 8,405 on 4 July in what was his eighth attempt to get elected to the House of Commons. Thomas Bowen's lawyer said she had received \"multiple threats\" since throwing the milkshake at Farage. In a statement following the sentencing, Caroline Liggins said: \"She understands the gravity of the situation in which her impulsive decision has placed her. \"She has suffered multiple threats since this happened, which have had a serious impact on her mental health. \"Victoria understands the impact of her actions and wishes to put the whole episode behind her. She hopes others can do the same.\" Rebecca Mundy, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said it was of \"paramount importance\" that elected officials felt safe to work \"without fear of harm or abuse\". \"Threatening behaviour and attacks on electoral candidates and officials will never be tolerated,\" she added. In August, Josh Greally, of Clowne, Derbyshire, was given a suspended sentence for throwing a coffee cup and another item at Farage while he was campaigning in Barnsley. During a campaign walkabout in Newcastle in 2019, the former UKIP leader and Euro MP had a banana and salted caramel milkshake thrown at him. \"Milkshaking\" - the act of dousing public figures with the drink - was recognised as a word by the Collins Dictionary in 2019.

Five are tourists, with one from the US and the rest from Australia, aged between 18 and 56. Two others are foreigners living in Fiji, according to local media reports citing the health ministry. Some were previously reported to be seriously ill, but local officials said on Monday that their symptoms have since improved and some were set to be discharged. The incident comes weeks after the deaths of six tourists in the South East Asian nation of Laos because of suspected methanol poisoning. Fiji tourism chief Brent Hill told RNZ they were keenly aware of the Laos incident, but added that the case in Fiji was \"a long way from that\".  Shortly after drinking the rum cocktail at the Warwick Fiji resort on the Coral Coast, the seven guests displayed nausea, vomiting and neurological symptoms. They were initially taken to Sigatoka Hospital, and later transferred to Lautoka Hospital, according to the Fiji Times. Fiji's tourism minister Viliame Gavok has stressed that this was an \"extremely isolated incident\" and that the resort claimed \"they have not engaged in practices such as substituting ingredients or altering the quality of drinks served to guests\". Initial investigations are under way and no further cases have been reported, authorities said. Sydney resident David Sandoe told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) that his daughter Tanya and granddaughter Georgia were among those affected. But he added they were returning home and doing \"very well\" considering what happened. \"It's very difficult to take a call at 11 at night... and your daughter says that they have been poisoned and they're in hospital,\" Mr Sandoe said, adding that Georgia had suffered a seizure. The ABC had previously reported a 56-year-old Australian woman was under medical surveillance in hospital and a 19-year-old Australian woman had suffered \"serious medical episodes\". The Warwick Fiji hotel said in a statement to the BBC that it was aware of the \"suspected alcohol poisoning\" and was taking it \"very seriously\". The hotel said it was \"conducting a thorough investigation\" while awaiting a \"test result report\" from the health authorities to \"gather all necessary information\". Fiji police are said to be investigating the circumstances of the incident. Two Australian families in Fiji are receiving consular assistance, an Australian foreign ministry spokesperson told the BBC. A New Zealand foreign affairs ministry spokesperson told the BBC it had \"not received any requests for assistance\" after the apparent poisoning incident. The BBC also understands that no British persons were affected in the incident. \"There's a real terrifying sense of deja vu,\" Australian minister Jason Clare told the ABC. Two 19-year-old Australian girls had died from suspected methanol poisoning in the Laos incident. Tourists have been advised to \"be alert to the potential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks in Fiji\" by Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT). The guidance said tourists should \"get urgent medical help if you suspect drink spiking\".

{"_id":{"$oid":"676030d0c3f742fb3373bb3b"},"title_or":"One in four babies in England born by Caesarean","description_or":"One out of every four babies is now born by Caesarean section, latest NHS data for England reveals.  The proportion has increased steadily over the past decade. Experts say it is linked to a \"growing number\" of more \"complex\" pregnancies - because the mother is older or obese, for example.  But some mothers are choosing to have a Caesarean - where the baby is delivered by surgeons cutting into the mother's abdomen and womb - for non-medical reasons. In 2013-14, 13% of deliveries were Caesareans.  Last year, of the 398,675 deliveries performed by the NHS in England where the method of starting labour was recorded, 101,264 (25%) were Caesareans. And of those, 67,100 were a planned or \"elective\" procedure. Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) president Dr Ranee Thakar said complex births were a \"major factor\".  \"We are seeing national rising rates of obesity and people choosing to have children at a later state in their life, both of which can increase the chance of complications,\" she said. The likelihood of a Caesarean increased with the mother's age.  And for those aged over 39, it was the most common method of delivery. Most women under 30, meanwhile, had \"spontaneous\" vaginal births, without medical intervention to start labour.  A third of all deliveries were induced, meaning labour was started using artificial methods such as a hormone drip or a pessary. The RCOG does not promote one form of birth over another.  Experts say women should have a choice about how they give birth, whenever possible and safe. And the NHS recently removed a limit on how many Caesareans it performs. Maternity units were previously encouraged to promote natural births and keep the Caesarean rate to about 20%. But NHS advice now says women have the right to a planned Caesarean if safe.  An NHS spokesman said: \"A Caesarean is a major operation that comes with risks, so it's usually done when it's the safest option for women and their baby. \"However, some do choose to have a C-section for a non-medical reason. \"NHS maternity teams across the country are fully committed to providing the safest and most personalised care possible to all women, according to best-practice guidance and informed by evidence, to help them to achieve the type of birth they would like.\"","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8ew4jjr252o","published_time":"2024-12-16T11:52:58.848903Z","author_name":"Michelle Roberts","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/eb5a/live/2e2b92e0-bb9a-11ef-acfc-7396dc948a8a.jpg.webp"],"source":"bbc","category":"Entertainment","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-16T19:22:58.849Z"}}

The 46-year-old died at the scene after being found with serious injuries when  officers were called out to reports of shots being fired at about 21:15 GMT in Gifford Road, Harlesden. Two men in their 30s sustained serious injuries - one of them remains in a critical condition. There have been no arrests so far. Ms Sadio has not yet been formally identified but the Met has said it is confident about her identity. Her family are being supported by specialist officers, the force said. The BBC understands the shooting happened after a gathering at the River of Life Elim Pentecostal Church on Gifford Road. The building and surrounding area remains cordoned off as police investigations continue. One local resident have told the BBC the sound of \"people screaming\" could be heard coming from the direction of the church. Others said they heard what they thought were fireworks being let off as the incident unfolded.  One resident said he heard five gunshots in a row. Susan Jones told the BBC she had recently moved to the area with her partner and sons. She described incident as shocking and worrying. She added: \"Having three boys already, raising them is tricky anyway… but the area counts a lot... it kind of made me feel a bit shaken and insecure about the whole thing.\" The Met's Supt Tony Josephs described the shooting as \"truly shocking\". He added that it was likely to cause concern in the local area and said he hoped witnesses would come forward. \"I want to reassure people that a team of experienced detectives are already working at pace to piece together the events of last night and identify whoever was responsible for this heinous act of violence,\" he said. Ms Sadio is believed to be the first female victim of fatal gun crime in London since 43-year-old Hackney mother Lianne Gordon was shot dead through her front door in December last year.  Ms Gordon was the only woman to die as a result of gun crime in London between 2019-2023 - a period in which 55 men were killed in this way. While gun crime against females remains rare, notable recent non-fatal incidents include the shooting of an eight-year-old girl in Ladbroke Grove in November and that of a nine-year-old girl in Dalston in May.

{"_id":{"$oid":"676030d0c3f742fb3373bb3e"},"title_or":"Robbie Williams on why he's played by a chimp in new film","description_or":"Robbie Williams is thoroughly enjoying his wander into the world of film, even if he is still learning the correct lingo. \"I was at this thing called the Governors' Ball the other night. That was amazing,\" the singer says. He is talking about the Governors' Awards, held in Los Angeles, where he joined other guests including Tom Hanks, Angelina Jolie and Daniel Craig. \"I'm super excited because it's all brand new to me. I feel like an artist that's just been signed. I'm full of hope, full of excitement, bewildered by it all.\" The project that currently has him walking red carpets with the biggest names in Hollywood is his biopic Better Man. \"Kevin Costner sought me out,\" he giggles, adding with growing incredulity: \"He wanted to come and tell me about the movie.\" Better Man deals with Williams' life from childhood, through the Take That years, to about 2003, the year he broke records by playing three huge gigs at Knebworth (with the aim of annoying Oasis, who had only managed two). The twist in the tale, or tail, is that throughout the film, and with no explanation, he is portrayed on screen as a monkey. At least that is how everyone involved in the film refers to the animal. If Sir David Attenborough veered into film reviewing, he would be quick to point out, in hushed tones, that the creature singing Angels and Rock DJ is a chimpanzee, not a monkey - because it has no tail. To paraphrase the debut album of Williams' old boyband, Ape That and Party. Williams is speaking to me at London's Soho Hotel, a venue so popular with the movie industry that at the exact same time, Rupert Everett is presenting an award on one floor, while in the basement there is a screening of a documentary produced by Jennifer Lawrence. Williams is sitting next to Michael Gracey, the director of 2017 hit The Greatest Showman. Now, after a gap of seven years, Better Man is Gracey's next film, and it was his idea to turn the main man into a monkey. For a year and half, Williams and Gracey had been sending messages back and forth, discussing a possible film musical based on his life. \"There have been a lot of musical biopics,\" says Gracey. \"I wanted to come at this with a different lens. \"Quite often Rob will say, 'I'm just like a performing monkey' or 'I'm up the back like a performing monkey'. \"It just sparked this idea of, we've got this chance to tell this story, not from the perspective of how we see Rob, but how he sees himself. \"And so I pitched the idea to Rob. I said, 'You know, if you were to be an animal, how would you see yourself?'\" Williams takes up the story: \"I was looking for some self-worth at the time and I was like, 'I am a lion'. And he just cocked his head and went, 'Mmmm.' \"I went, 'Monkey?' \"And he went, 'Yeah, so here's the idea.' And before the end of the sentence was out of his mouth, I'm like, 'Yes, that, that, that, please'.\" The monkey was created by Weta, the special effects company responsible for Gollum in Lord of the Rings and Caesar in Planet of the Apes. They used a combination of motion capture and CGI, with the role and the speaking voice taken on by English actor Jonno Davies, best known as Tobias in the Al Pacino TV series Hunters. But it turns out that the original plan was for Williams himself to play the monkey. \"I was going to, but it involved me leaving my family for loads and loads of months,\" he says. \"And the thought of that was just too much for me to bear. \"There are loads of things that I want to do that are just best being an idea. It was great at dinner parties, 'I'm playing me in a story about me.' \"And by the time it came round to it, I was bored of the idea. 'I've said it at dinner parties now. I've done it.'\" Williams did perform the whole of My Way while wired up to help with the motion capture, at a specially arranged pair of concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in 2022. \"We also scanned his eyes,\" explains Gracey, \"So when you look at the monkey's eyes, it's actually one for one Rob's eyes.\" \"I kind of don't want to know which bit's me and which bit's not me,\" interrupts Williams. \"I want the magic of the film just to be the magic of the film. \"Also, Jonno, who plays me, has got a wonderful bottom and I want to believe that bit is me, that my bum will be memorialised as that epic.\" Robbie Williams sums up Better Man as \"the greatest hits of my trauma for the TikTok generation\". And the film doesn't shy away from dealing with his drug addictions and mental health problems, or when Nicole Appleton from All Saints was pregnant with their child and was pressured by people in the music industry, she said, into having an abortion. \"My part in her life I still have shame about. It's the most difficult part of the film for me to watch,\" Williams admits. \"She did me no harm and is a kind, lovely person. I was an idiot younger boyfriend.\" Appleton is supportive of the film and was consulted throughout production - unlike Williams' father Peter Conway, a singer with whom he has performed many times over the years. In Better Man, he is played by Inside No 9's Steve Pemberton and portrayed as someone who let down his family. \"He hasn't seen it yet. And I don't know if I want him to,\" says Williams. \"I haven't spoken to him about it. I'm embarrassed. I love my dad. Best mate, charming, wonderful man. \"But as it is with everybody's childhood, like the Philip Larkin poem, 'They mess you up your mum and dad.' And I'm messing my kids up.\" The film also paints a pretty poisonous portrait of Williams' time in Take That. \"There's a pattern - boys join a boyband, boyband becomes huge, boys get sick. And I don't think anybody gets to escape that,\" is his summary. \"I don't know what it is completely about fame that warps. I just know that it does. I know that young fame, in particular, is corrosive and toxic. It should come with a health warning.\" The death earlier this year of One Direction's Liam Payne, who he mentored on The X Factor in 2010, has made him want to change the way boybands are looked after. \"It's going to take a bunch of creatives to sit around, and I want to head that. I want to do that,\" he says. \"It has to be creative people, not members of Parliament or record company bosses. I think this needs to be oversensitive people with complicated inner lives, who understand what it's like to have a complicated inner life and what help that would need.\" But these plans will have to wait. At the moment, Williams' full attention is on the film and the Oscars. Success in the US is quite a change for a singer who famously never broke America. (Angels reached 53 in the Billboard chart, Millennium 72 and that was it.) In 2002, he even made fun of the situation with the self-deprecating I Will Talk And Hollywood Will Listen, in which the title rhymed with the lyric \"Mr Spielberg look just what you're missing\". How things change. Better Man has already earned a Golden Globe nomination for best song. And on Tuesday, he will find out whether Forbidden Road, which plays over the end credits, is among the 15 songs on the shortlist for the Academy Awards. And there are other categories in which the film could get a nomination. \"Best visual effects,\" starts Gracey, before Williams interjects once more. \"Best musical monkey!\" he beams. Gracey laughs. \"If that was a category, we would definitely win.\" Hollywood is indeed starting to listen. Better Man opens in cinema on 26 December.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7r21egd82o","published_time":"2024-12-16T00:53:01.498860Z","author_name":"Colin Paterson","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f391/live/6fb5b360-bb88-11ef-a2ca-e99d0c9a24e3.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6d1b/live/d995de20-b865-11ef-90f0-f97cf90e571c.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/19ba/live/d91eb8b0-b86d-11ef-a0f2-fd81ae5962f4.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/faa6/live/205eb300-b964-11ef-a937-bb0098f9a5d0.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2319/live/e7eb8cd0-b979-11ef-a2ca-e99d0c9a24e3.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d810/live/c48daf70-b965-11ef-a76e-4d65d4c6203f.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b1eb/live/cb700fc0-bb88-11ef-a0f2-fd81ae5962f4.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6a50/live/bd6471b0-b86c-11ef-a72c-55cc49f950c5.jpg.webp"],"source":"bbc","category":"Entertainment","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-16T19:23:01.499Z"}}
{"_id":{"$oid":"676030d0c3f742fb3373bb3f"},"title_or":"How families' bitter and bloody feud spilled onto Glasgow's streets","description_or":"On the afternoon of 6 December 2006, two men in a blue Mazda pulled up outside a garage in Lambhill, in the north of Glasgow. Raymond Anderson and James McDonald put on old man face masks before stepping out of the car. What happened next was later likened by defence lawyer Donald Findlay KC to \"a scene from The Godfather\". Dressed in trench coats, the pair walked into Applerow Motors, off the busy Balmore Road, and opened fire. The owner, David Lyons, took cover but his 21-year-old nephew Michael was shot dead. Steven Lyons, David's nephew, was injured along with his associate Robert Pickett, who lost a kidney. The hitmen were enforcers for the Daniel crime clan, believed by police to be led by Jamie Daniel. The Daniels were locked in a bitter battle with the Lyons family, who were based in Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire. A bloody gangland feud which had largely been conducted in the shadows was now headline news. The deadly rivalry, which dates back more than 20 years, is now the focus of a new BBC Radio 5 Live true crime podcast. Gangster: The Daniels and the Lyons chronicles the savage battle for control of Glasgow's drugs trade. The six-part series also details the fall-out from multiple shootings and countless tit-for-tat attacks. Ten days after the murder, David Lyons received a \"ransom note\" through the post. It read: \"The boys owe me £25,000 and I want what's owed to me. It's for drugs. \"They all know what it's about as they have got to pay the piper.\" The High Court in Glasgow later heard that Mr Lyons did not pay the money and instead handed the letter to police. Anderson and McDonald were placed under surveillance which eventually led officers to a house in the Garthamlock area where a machine gun, grenades and ammunition were discovered. Both men were heard calling themselves \"The Untouchables\" and talking about the mysterious \"piper\", who was mentioned in the letter sent to Mr Lyons. They were also linked to military weapons which had been stolen from army barracks. In May 2008 Anderson, 49, and McDonald, 27, were convicted and each sentenced to 35 years in jail, which was later reduced on appeal. The judge, Lord Hardie, described the killing as a \"cold-blooded, premeditated assassination\". The murder was rooted in a feud said to date back to 2001 when a £20,000 stash of cocaine disappeared from a Daniel safe house in Milton, in the north of Glasgow, during a party.  Graeme Pearson, former director general of the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency, told the podcast: \"It was alleged that members of the Lyons family group stole a delivery of drugs that were due for the Daniel family and there had been a real upset about the theft of those drugs. \"Equally, it was alleged that the Lyons family had decided that they were also retailing in the north side [of Glasgow], where the Daniel family traditionally had the upper hand. \"This was their territory. This was where they made profit and they wouldn't stand for it. That couldn't go without some response.\" The fall-out from the missing drugs rapidly progressed from car chases to shootings. Among the early victims were Kevin \"Gerbil\" Carroll - a major figure in the Daniel clan - and Johnny Lyons, brother of David and Eddie Snr. Both were shot and injured in separate attacks just 11 days apart in January 2003. Then, in November 2006, Carroll allegedly used a 4x4 and a tow rope to topple the headstone of Eddie Snr's son Garry, who was only eight when he died of leukaemia in 1991.  The desecration of his grave marked a new low. Days later Carroll ambushed and shot Eddie Lyons Jnr and a friend in Bellshill, Lanarkshire. But a week later he was injured in a retaliatory shooting in Bishopbriggs, East Dunbartonshire. Police were deploying significant resources in a bid to manage the dispute but the violence was escalating. It was no secret that Carroll was the most unpredictable player in the whole feud. His rivalry with the Lyons clan stretched back to his schooldays when he was reportedly bullied by members of the family. Carroll, who earned his nickname from a character in the TV puppet series Roland Rat, later forged close friendships with the Daniel clan. Aged 19 he was jailed for three months for car theft and by his mid-20s he was a major criminal player on the north side of Glasgow. In 2004 he was charged with trying to kill a friend of Eddie Lyons Snr with an AK-47 but the trial later collapsed. Carroll - who shared a £217,000 house with Jamie Daniel's daughter in Lennoxtown - could have been forgiven for thinking he was above the law. By 2009 he was out of control and struck fear into rivals by masterminding a series of \"alien abductions\" across central Scotland. The kidnappings were described in such a way as the victims, who were tortured and robbed, told police they couldn't remember anything about their ordeal. Carroll's brutality and pattern of offending ensured he had many enemies and he went to great lengths to cover his tracks. If his rivals wanted to target him then they would have to stage an audacious ambush unlike anything that had gone before. On 13 January 2010 Carroll attended a lunchtime business meeting at Asda in Robroyston, Glasgow. Days earlier he had shot and injured Eddie Lyons Jnr on the arm. Now Carroll had arranged to poach drug pusher Stephen Glen, who was linked to the Lyons family. A trial later heard Carroll, 29, told him: \"You're working for me now. Anybody that doesn't fall into line is going to get banged.\" But at 13:23, minutes after delivering the ultimatum, he was sitting in the back of a black Audi A3 when a speeding Volkswagen Golf screeched to a halt in front of the vehicle. Carroll's two associates fled leaving him trapped in the back of the three-door car. Two masked men emerged from the Golf and opened fire, shattering the rear passenger windows. Carroll was shot in the head and chest - 13 times in total - in an attack that lasted 25 seconds. William \"Buff\" Paterson, fled to Spain 10 days after the murder and later featured in a 10 most wanted appeal by the then UK Serious Organised Crime Agency. But after more than four years on the run he eventually handed himself in at a police station in Madrid. During his trial, at the High Court in Glasgow, Carroll's notoriety was highlighted when a list of 99 potential suspects was read out. Paterson was later convicted and jailed for 22 years. The judge, Lord Armstrong, told him: \"It was not a spontaneous event which happened on the spur of the moment, it was in effect an execution.\" The murder, which was committed in front of horrified lunchtime shoppers, was arguably the most public gangland hit ever carried out in Scotland. It also paved the way for further brazen attacks. In September 2015 Ross Sherlock was shot as he walked down a lane from St Helen's Primary School in Bishopbriggs. At the time the kitchen fitter was chatting to another parent as their daughters walked hand-in-hand in front. Two men were later cleared of the attempted murder. And in January 2017, Ross Monaghan was shot outside St George's Primary School in Penilee, shortly after dropping his daughter off at school. Five years earlier, he had been acquitted of murdering Carroll after a judge ruled there was insufficient evidence. Two men later went on trial for the Monaghan murder bid but were cleared only to be later convicted of other organised crime offences. In between the school shootings there was another major development.  Jamie Daniel, who became a millionaire after starting out as a scrap metal dealer in Possil, died of cancer in July 2016. The convicted heroin smuggler made his fortune through drugs and, latterly, counterfeit cigarettes. But his death, at the age of 58, left a power vacuum and the future of his crime group was cast into doubt. There was no obvious successor, especially as his son Zander Sutherland was serving a 13-and-a-half-year jail term for heroin dealing. Sutherland later fled the UK while on day release from prison and is now in Norway fighting extradition. Meanwhile, the Lyons group responded to Daniel's death with a brutal campaign of intimidation against his associates, which included five attempted murders in five months. Robert Daniel was the first target. On 8 December 2016 his car was rammed by another vehicle before he was chased into a house in Robroyston. Once inside he was struck twice on the back of the head with what he later told police was a hatchet or a machete. Asked in court if he was aware of any ill-feeling between the Daniel and Lyons families, Robert, 29, replied: \"Not that I know of.\" A month later Thomas Bilsland, 31, suffered a fractured skull after he was set upon in Glasgow's Cranhill. The next victim, Gary Petty, was targeted after he visited an Italian restaurant on 7 March 2017. A court heard the 22-year-old was getting out his Volkswagen Golf when he was ambushed in Maryhill. Ryan Fitzsimmons, 34, was attacked by a masked gang on 28 April 2017 outside his home in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire. The former soldier, who was left brain damaged, told the trial: \"It felt like death was coming.\" His mother Geraldine, 61, was so affected by what happened that she suffered a heart attack in the street. Mr Fitzsimmons told jurors he had \"no enemies\" but jurors heard his older brother was once charged with shooting Ross Monaghan, the man cleared of murdering Carroll in 2010. The most savage crime on the 13-page indictment was the assault on Stephen \"Bonzo\" Daniel on 18 May 2017. As he headed home after dropping off friends his Skoda Octavia was deliberately hit by a Volkswagen Golf in Milton. An Audi S3 soon joined the chase through north Glasgow during which the vehicles involved reach speeds of up to 100mph. Daniel's car eventually crashed on an off ramp of the M8 in the Port Dundas area. The impact left him unconscious and the 39-year-old later told a court he had no memory of what happened next. As he lay slumped at the wheel Daniel was subjected to a horrific attack with bladed weapons which left him with facial wounds so severe that first responders initially thought he had been shot. The court also heard the ex-taxi firm director's car was found to have had a tracking device on it but he insisted he had no enemies before the incident. Gangland investigations pose a massive challenge for law enforcement as detectives are typically met with a wall of silence. But the sophisticated technology deployed by the Lyons group to plot the attacks also enabled officers to build a case against them. And in May 2019 six associates of the family were jailed for a total of 104 years after being found guilty of five murder plots. The judge, Lord Mulholland, told the gang: \"You sought to turn Glasgow into a war zone for your feud. \"This is a civilised city, which is based on the rule of law. \"There is no place for this type of conduct, retribution or the law of the jungle.\" Five years on, the feud - which has also been linked to a number of prison attacks - is back in the spotlight. And presenter Livvy Haydock described the new podcast as the \"most bloody and brutal\" Gangster series to date. She added: \"This investigation has been eye-opening and uncovers the story of two of Glasgow's most notorious crime families. \"It's a vicious war which has raged on for 20 years and is still going on to this day.\" Gangster: The Daniels and the Lyons is available as a boxset on BBC Sounds and on other platforms weekly.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20e6g5xdx9o","published_time":"2024-12-16T05:53:01.985449Z","author_name":"Paul O'Hare","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3ca6/live/4a64c1a0-b7dc-11ef-a2ca-e99d0c9a24e3.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2b7b/live/cbc06430-b178-11ef-a2ca-e99d0c9a24e3.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5072/live/9eb14200-b7e7-11ef-a2ca-e99d0c9a24e3.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7591/live/5c6509d0-b7d4-11ef-a9d0-3bb2d253170d.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4a62/live/0bdbf3e0-b7e6-11ef-a2ca-e99d0c9a24e3.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/594a/live/1a0710f0-b177-11ef-84e6-298a2db62aed.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d273/live/9bc36b80-b7d4-11ef-a0f2-fd81ae5962f4.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4a83/live/4a66e380-b7e7-11ef-aff0-072ce821b6ab.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/78ab/live/2373b2f0-b7ea-11ef-a0f2-fd81ae5962f4.jpg.webp"],"source":"bbc","category":"Business","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-16T19:23:01.986Z"}}
{"_id":{"$oid":"676030d0c3f742fb3373bb40"},"title_or":"Why Final Fantasy director almost rejected his dream job","description_or":"When Naoki Hamaguchi found out he'd landed his dream job directing remakes of his favourite game, Final Fantasy VII, he almost didn't accept. \"I realised this was going to be 10 years of my life as a games developer and I was a little torn,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat. As video games have become more advanced the time - and budgets - needed to create them have grown. For the people in charge of those projects it can mean committing a big chunk of your life, career and identity to them. And there are few projects on the scale of the new Final Fantasy VII series. A trilogy of games remaking the beloved 1997 classic with updated visuals, full voice-acting and a wealth of side content, it is a massive undertaking. So far, it has gone well. The first two games, subtitled Remake and Rebirth, released to excellent reviews and both were nominated for a string of awards. Mr Hamaguchi most recently accepted a Game Award for best score and music at the industry's biggest ceremony in Los Angeles. Newsbeat speaks to him at the Golden Joysticks in London, where Rebirth scoops prizes for Best Soundtrack, Best Storytelling and performance. The initial announcement of developer Square Enix's intention to split the project into three was met with some scepticism - the original game could be completed in about 40 hours. So does Mr Hamaguchi think he's proved the doubters wrong? \"I hope we've convinced them,\" he says.  \"With the original being so famous, so many people have their own visions of what Final Fantasy VII is. It’s very difficult to please absolutely every single fan out there.\" Despite his own concerns about the remakes taking up so much of his professional life, he says he's happy he took the plunge. \"Final Fantasy was one of the big inspirations for me to want to become a game creator in the first place,\" he says.  \"This was my way of giving back to the series.\" But he admits he's looking forward to doing something different.  \"I want to move away from it an take on a completely new kind of challenge\", he says. \"I've given everything I have to this.\" Mr Hamaguchi says the game development climate when the first game was released means the approach to making the new games is fundamentally different. Because it takes years to make a blockbuster game for modern machines, he says teams need to think about how the landscape will look in five to ten years' time. For example, emerging markets such as the Middle East and South East Asia \"are undergoing very rapid economic growth\" and creating a new generation of gamers.  \"It's really interesting to see so many young people getting into gaming in these regions,\" he says. In contrast to making a game 20 years ago, developers need to make sure cultural references work across regions where video games are more popular than they once were. The games market is tougher, too.  Square Enix has said Rebirth - which released exclusively on PlayStation 5 - did not perform as well as it had hoped, and it recently confirmed a PC version would be coming soon. People play on more platforms and there's evidence that many gamers are sticking with a \"home game\" such as Fortnite, Roblox or Call of Duty for longer periods. Drawing them away is hard, but Mr Hamaguchi says the buzz from an awards nomination can give a game a boost.  \"Previously we'd release a game on a console and it would sell very well for the first couple of weeks,\" he says.  An award mention can help a title stand out from the crowd and push it to the front page of online storefronts. Final Fantasy VII's history stretches back more than 20 years, but does Mr Hamaguchi have any thoughts on where gaming might be in the same amount of time in the future? \"Something along the lines of virtual reality, or perhaps more like augmented reality, where you can create a digital environment which merges with the real world and people can interact with things in that world,\" he says. \"I think that’s a very different feeling to what we have when we play games with a standard controller today\".  He also predicts headsets could become cheap and lightweight enough so we can enter and interact with games in much more immersive ways.  For now, thought, he'll be focusing on the final part of the new trilogy, hoping to be up on the awards stage again.

{"_id":{"$oid":"676030d0c3f742fb3373bb41"},"title_or":"Gisèle Pelicot removes all traces of her husband from her life","description_or":"Warning: This story contains descriptions of sexual abuse It was November 2011, and Gisèle Pelicot was sleeping too much. She spent most of her weekends in a slumber. She was annoyed, because during the week she worked hard as a supply chain manager, and her time off was precious.  Yet she could not seem to stay awake, often drifting off without even realising it and waking hours later with no memory of having gone to bed. Despite this, Gisèle, 58, was happy. She counted herself lucky to have her husband of 38 years, Dominique, by her side. Now their three children Caroline, David and Florian were grown, the couple were planning to soon retire and move to Mazan, a village of 6,000 people in France's idyllic southern region of Provence, where Mr Pelicot could go on bike rides and she could take Lancôme, their French bulldog, on long walks. She had loved Dominique since they met in the early 1970s. \"When I saw that young man in a blue jumper it was love at first sight,\" Gisèle would reflect, much later. They both had complicated family histories marked by loss and trauma, and had found peace with one another. Their four decades together had hit rough patches - frequent financial troubles and her affair with a colleague in the mid-1980s – but they had made it through. Years later, when asked by a lawyer to sum up their relationship, she said: \"Our friends used to say we were the perfect couple. And I thought we would see our days through together.\" By that point, Gisèle and Dominique were sitting on opposite sides of a courtroom in Avignon, not far from Mazan: she surrounded by their children and her lawyers, and he, dressed in grey, prison-issue clothes, in the defendants' glass box. He was facing the maximum jail term for aggravated rape and was rapidly becoming known in France and beyond as – in his own daughter's words – \"one of the worst sexual predators of the last 20 years\". But in 2011, when Gisèle felt she was sleeping too much, she couldn't have guessed that was how things would play out. She had no idea that, in his late 50s and nearing retirement, her husband Dominique Pelicot had been spending a lot of time on the internet, often talking to users on open forums and chatrooms where sexual material – often extreme or illegal – was freely available. In court, he would later pinpoint that phase as the trigger for his \"perversion\" after a childhood trauma of rape and abuse: \"We become perverted when we find something that gives us the means: the internet.\" Sometime between 2010 and 2011, a man claiming to be a nurse sent Mr Pelicot photos of his wife, drugged with sleeping pills to the point of unconsciousness. He also shared precise instructions with Mr Pelicot so that he could do the same to Gisèle. At first he hesitated – but not for long. Through trial and error he realised that with the right dosage of pills he could plunge his wife into a sleep so deep nothing would wake her. They had been lawfully prescribed by his doctor, who thought Mr Pelicot suffered from anxiety due to financial troubles. He would then be able to dress her in lingerie she refused to wear, or put her through sexual practices she would have never accepted while conscious. He could film the scenes, which she would not have allowed while awake. Initially, he was the only one raping her. But by the time the couple had settled in Mazan in 2014, he had perfected and expanded his operation. He kept tranquilisers in a shoebox in the garage, and switched brands because the first tasted \"too salty\" to be surreptitiously added to his wife's food and drink, he said later. On a chatroom called \"without her knowledge\" he recruited men of all ages to come and abuse his wife. He would film them too. He told the court his wife's unconscious state was clear to the 71 men who came to their house over the course of a decade. \"You're just like me, you like rape mode,\" he told one of them in the chat. As the years went by, the effects of the abuse Ms Pelicot was subjected to at night increasingly began to seep into her waking life. She lost weight, clumps of hair fell out and her blackouts became more frequent. She was riddled with anxiety, certain that she was nearing death. Her family became worried. She had seemed healthy and active when she had visited them. \"We'd ring her but most of the time it was Dominique who picked up. He would tell us Gisèle was asleep, even in the middle of the day,\" said her son-in-law Pierre. \"But it seemed likely because she was doing so much [when she was with us], especially running after the grandchildren.\" Sometimes, Gisèle came close to having suspicions. Once, she had noticed the green colour of a beer her husband had handed her, and hastily poured it down the sink. Another time, she noticed a bleach stain she couldn't recall making on a new pair of trousers. \"You're not drugging me by any chance, are you?\" she remembered asking him. He broke down in tears: \"How can you accuse me of such a thing?\" Mostly, though, she felt lucky to have him with her as she navigated her health issues. She developed gynaecological problems, and underwent several neurological tests to determine if she was suffering from Alzheimer's or a brain tumour, as she feared, but the results didn't explain the increasing tiredness and the blackouts. Several years later, during the trial, Dominique's brother Joel, a doctor, was asked how it was possible that medical professionals had never put the clues together and understood Gisèle was a victim of the little-known phenomenon of chemical submission – drug-facilitated rape. \"In the field of medicine we only find what we're looking for, and we look for what we know,\" he replied. Gisèle only felt better when she was away from Mazan – an oddity she barely noticed. It was on her return from one of these trips, in September 2020, that Dominique told her, in floods of tears: \"I did something stupid. I was caught filming under women's clothes in a supermarket,\" she recalled during the trial.  She was very surprised, she said, because \"in 50 years he had never behaved inappropriately or used obscene words towards women\". She said she forgave him but asked him to promise her he would seek help. He acquiesced, \"and we left it at that\", she said. But Dominique must have known the end was near.  Soon after he was arrested in the supermarket, police confiscated his two phones and his laptop, where they would inevitably find more than 20,000 videos and photos of his wife being raped by him and others. \"I watched those videos for hours. It was troubling. Of course it had an impact on me,\" Jérémie Bosse Platière, the director of the investigation, told the court.  \"In 33 years in the police, I'd never really seen that sort of thing,\" his colleague Stéphane Gal said. \"It was sordid, it was shocking.\" His team was tasked with tracking down the men in the videos. They cross-checked the faces and names of the men carefully logged by Dominique alongside facial recognition technology. They were eventually able to identify 54 of them, while another 21 remained nameless. Some of the men who were unidentified said in conversations with Dominique that they were also drugging their partners. \"That, for me, is the most painful part of the case,\" Mr Bosse Platière said. \"To know that there are some women out there who could still be victims of their husbands.\" On 2 November 2020, Dominique and Gisèle had breakfast together before heading to a police station, where Mr Pelicot had been summoned in relation to the upskirting incident. She was asked by a policeman to follow him into another room. She confirmed Dominque was her husband -  \"a great guy, a good man\" –  but denied ever taking part in swinging with him, or engaging in threesomes. \"I will show you something you won't like,\" the police chief warned her, before showing her a picture of a sexual act.  At first, she didn't recognise any of the two people.  When she did, \"I told him to stop... Everything caved in, everything I built for 50 years\". She was sent home in a state of shock, accompanied by a friend. She had to tell her children what had happened. Recalling that moment, Gisèle said that her \"daughter's screams are forever etched in my mind\". Caroline, David and Florian came down to Mazan and cleared out the house. Later, photos of a seemingly drugged Caroline were also found on Dominique's laptop, although he has denied abusing her. David, the eldest child, said they no longer had any family photos because they \"got rid of everything linked to my father there and then\". Within days, Gisèle's life was reduced to a suitcase and her dog. Meanwhile, Dominique admitted to his crimes and was formally arrested. He thanked police for \"relieving him of a burden\". He and Gisèle wouldn't meet again until they sat facing one another in the Avignon courtroom in September 2024. By then, the story of the husband who drugged his wife for a decade and invited strangers to rape her had started to ripple across the world, aided by Gisèle's unusual and remarkable decision to waive her anonymity and open the trial to the public and the media. \"I want any woman who wakes up one morning with no memories of the night before to remember what I said,\" she stated. \"So that no more women can fall prey to chemical submission. I was sacrificed on the altar of vice, and we need to talk about it.\" Her legal team also successfully pushed for the videos taken to be shown in court, arguing they would \"undo the thesis of accidental rape\" – pushing back against the line of defence that the men had not meant to rape Gisèle as they didn't realise she was unconscious. \"She wanted shame to change sides and it has,\" a woman who came to watch the trial in Avignon said in November. \"Gisèle turned everything on its head. We weren't expecting a woman like this.\" Medical examiner Anne Martinat Sainte-Beuve said that in the wake of her husband's arrest, Gisèle was clearly traumatised but calm and distant – a coping mechanism often employed by survivors of terrorist attacks. Gisèle herself has said that she is \"a field of ruins\" and that she fears the rest of her life may not be enough to rebuild herself.  Ms Sainte-Beuve said she had found Gisèle \"exceptionally resilient\": \"She turned what could have destroyed her into strength.\" Days before the trial started, the Pelicots' divorce was finalised. Gisèle has gone back to her maiden name. She went by the name Pelicot for the trial so that her grandchildren could be \"proud\" of being related to her and not ashamed of being associated to Dominique. She has since moved to a village far from Mazan. She sees a psychiatrist but doesn't take any medication, because she no longer wants to ingest any substance. She continues to go on long walks, but is no longer tired. In the early days of the trial, Caroline's husband Pierre took the stand. A defence lawyer asked him about the Mazan years, when Gisèle was suffering from memory loss and her husband was dutifully accompanying her to unfruitful medical appointments. How could the family not have realised what was happening? Pierre shook his head. \"You are forgetting one thing,\" he said. \"You cannot imagine the unimaginable.\" If you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgx7xy77ydo","published_time":"2024-12-14T13:53:02.927599Z","author_name":"Laura Gozzi","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/019c/live/22a0f310-ba2e-11ef-a0f2-fd81ae5962f4.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a370/live/1b672490-ba27-11ef-a0f2-fd81ae5962f4.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/422e/live/ecd66630-ba18-11ef-a0f2-fd81ae5962f4.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/848a/live/2a3bb700-ba19-11ef-a2ca-e99d0c9a24e3.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8c36/live/8d2a0f20-ba18-11ef-aff0-072ce821b6ab.jpg.webp"],"source":"bbc","category":"Business","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-16T19:23:02.928Z"}}
{"_id":{"$oid":"676030d0c3f742fb3373bb42"},"title_or":"Why a nation of 1.45 billion wants more children","description_or":"Last year, India nudged past China to become the world's most populous country, according to UN estimates. With nearly 1.45 billion people now, you'd think the country would be quiet about having more children. But guess what? The chatter has suddenly picked up. Leaders of two southern states – Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu – have recently advocated more children. Andhra Pradesh is mulling providing incentives, citing low fertility rates and ageing population. The state also scrapped its \"two-child policy\" for local body elections, and reports say neighbouring Telangana may soon do the same. Next-door Tamil Nadu is also making similar, more exaggerated, noises. India's fertility rate has fallen substantially - from 5.7 births per woman in 1950 to the current rate of two.  Fertility rates have fallen below the replacement level of two births per woman in 17 of the 29 states and territories. (A replacement level is one at which new births are sufficient to maintain a stable population.) The five southern Indian states lead India's demographic transition, achieving replacement-level fertility well ahead of others. Kerala reached the milestone in 1988, Tamil Nadu in 1993, and the rest by the mid-2000s. Today, the five southern states have total fertility rates below 1.6, with Karnataka at 1.6 and Tamil Nadu at 1.4. In other words, fertility rates in these states match or are less than many European countries. But these states fear that India's shifting demographics with varying population shares between states, will significantly impact electoral representation and state wise-allocation of parliamentary seats and federal revenues.  \"They fear being penalised for their effective population control policies, despite being better economic performers and contributing significantly to federal revenues,\" Srinivas Goli, a professor of demography at the International Institute for Population Sciences, told the BBC. Southern states are also grappling with another major concern as India prepares for its first delimitation of electoral seats in 2026 - the first since 1976. This exercise will redraw electoral boundaries to reflect population shifts, likely reducing parliamentary seats for the economically prosperous southern states. As federal revenues are allocated based on state populations, many fear this could deepen their financial struggles and limit policy-making freedom. Demographers KS James and Shubhra Kriti project that populous northern states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar stand to gain more seats from delimitation, while southern states such as Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh could face losses, further shifting political representation. Many, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have hinted that changes to fiscal shares and parliamentary seat allocations will not be rushed through.  \"As a demographer, I don't think states should be overly concerned about these issues. They can be resolved through constructive negotiations between federal and state governments,\" says Mr Goli. \"My concern lies elsewhere.\" The key challenge, according to demographers, is India's rapid ageing driven by declining fertility rates. While countries like France and Sweden took 120 and 80 years respectively to double their aging population from 7% to 14%, India is expected to reach this milestone in just 28 years, says Mr Goli. This accelerated ageing is tied to India's unique success in fertility decline. In most countries, improved living standards, education, and urbanisation naturally lower fertility as child survival improves. But in India, fertility rates fell rapidly despite modest socio-economic progress, thanks to aggressive family welfare programmes that promoted small families through targets, incentives, and disincentives.  The unintended consequence? Take Andhra Pradesh, for instance. Its fertility rate is 1.5, on par with Sweden, but its per capita income is 28 times lower, says Mr Goli. With mounting debt and limited resources, can states like these support higher pensions or social security for a rapidly aging population?  Consider this. More than 40% of elderly Indians (60+ years) belong to the poorest wealth quintile - the bottom 20% of a population in terms of wealth distribution, according to United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)'s latest India Ageing Report. In other words, Mr Goli says, \"India is getting old before getting rich\". Fewer children also mean a rising old-age dependency ratio, leaving fewer caregivers for an expanding elderly demographic. Demographers warn that India's healthcare, community centres and old-age homes are unprepared for this shift. Urbanisation, migration, and changing labour markets are further eroding traditional family support - India's strong point - leaving more elderly people behind.  While migration from populous to less populous states can ease the working-age gap, it also sparks anti-migration anxieties. \"Robust investments in prevention, palliative care, and social infrastructure are urgently needed to look after the ageing,\" says  Mr Goli. As if the southern states' concerns weren't enough, earlier this month, the chief of the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (National Volunteers' Organisation), the ideological backbone of Mr Modi's BJP -  urged couples to have at least three children to secure India's future. \"According to population science, when growth falls below 2.1, a society perishes on its own. Nobody destroys it,\" Mohan Bhagwat reportedly said at a recent meeting. While Mr Bhagwat's concerns may have some basis, they are not entirely accurate, say demographers. Tim Dyson, a demographer at the London School of Economics, told the BBC that after a decade or two, continuing \"very low levels of fertility will lead to rapid population decline\". A fertility rate of 1.8 births per woman leads to a slow, manageable population decline. But a rate of 1.6 or lower could trigger \"rapid, unmanageable population decline\".   \"Smaller numbers of people will enter the reproductive - and main working - ages, and this will be socially, politically and economically disastrous. This is a demographic process and it is extremely difficult to reverse,\" says Mr Dyson. This is already happening in some countries. In May, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared the country's record-low birth rate a \"national emergency\" and announced plans for a dedicated government ministry. Greece's fertility rate has plummeted to 1.3, half of what it was in 1950, sparking warnings from Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis about an \"existential\" population threat.  But demographers say that urging people to have more children is futile. \"Considering the societal shifts, including the significant reduction in gender disparities as women's lives have become increasingly similar to those of men, this trend is unlikely to reverse,\" says Mr Dyson. WATCH: Why do some in India want couples to have more children? For Indian states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala, grappling with a declining workforce, the key question is: who will step in to fill the gap? Developed countries, unable to reverse declining fertility, are focusing on healthy and active ageing - prolonging working life by five to seven years and enhancing productivity in older populations. Demographers say India will need to extend retirement ages meaningfully, and policies must prioritise increasing healthy years through better health screenings, and stronger social security to ensure an active and productive older population - a potential \"silver dividend\". India must also leverage its demographic dividend better - economic growth that occurs when a country has a large, working-age population. Mr Goli believes there's a window of opportunity until 2047 to boost the economy, create jobs for the working-age population, and allocate resources for the ageing. \"We're only reaping 15-20% of the dividend - we can do much better,\" he says. The headline of this piece was updated to better reflect the story.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9088men9xo","published_time":"2024-12-15T23:53:03.653714Z","author_name":"Soutik Biswas","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0718/live/0e980850-b933-11ef-9325-0fd728530b68.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fa33/live/23a0f040-b6f4-11ef-aff0-072ce821b6ab.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f305/live/18c8acd0-b933-11ef-9325-0fd728530b68.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8bcc/live/1fe42210-b933-11ef-9325-0fd728530b68.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/78be/live/80198900-b6f3-11ef-a2ca-e99d0c9a24e3.jpg.webp"],"source":"bbc","category":"World","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-16T19:23:03.654Z"}}

{"_id":{"$oid":"676030d0c3f742fb3373bb44"},"title_or":"Rapper Slowthai breaks down as he is cleared of rape","description_or":"Grammy-nominated rapper Slowthai has been cleared of raping a fan after one of his shows. The 29-year-old, whose real name is Tyron Frampton, had been accused of raping the woman following his performance at The Bullingdon, in Oxford, in September 2021. He and his co-accused, Alex Blake-Walker, were both found not guilty on three joint counts of rape following a trial at Oxford Crown Court.  Mr Blake-Walker was also cleared on one count of sexual assault. As the not guilty verdicts were read out, Mr Frampton broke down in tears in dock, while members of the public gallery audibly sobbed. The jury, made up of eight men and four women, reached its majority not guilty verdicts after more than 10 hours of deliberation. The trial heard that a group of women who Mr Frampton had met before his show on the Cowley Road in Oxford had invited the rapper and his friends to a party at one of their houses. The prosecution had alleged Mr Blake-Walker had raped the one woman whilst being encouraged by Mr Frampton - who, it was alleged, then twice raped the second complainant. Mr Frampton agreed that sexual activity had taken place between him and the second complainant, but insisted it had been consensual. Giving evidence during the trial, he said: \"I know she was consenting, there wasn't a question.\" Mr Frampton, of Wellingborough Road, Northampton, was supported throughout the trial at Oxford Crown Court by his wife, the popstar Anne-Marie. Defending Mr Frampton, Patrick Gibbs KC earlier told the court that his client would be \"cancelled for the rest of time\", whatever the outcome of the trial. In his closing remarks, Mr Gibbs said Slowthai \"wasn't everybody's stereotype of a rapper\", adding he was a \"thoughtful\" and \"modest\" man who \"throws himself, sometimes recklessly, into life\". \"Even if he [Mr Frampton] is acquitted, it [the allegations] will not leave him,\" he added.

{"_id":{"$oid":"676030d0c3f742fb3373bb45"},"title_or":"Turkey and sprouts drives down cost of Christmas dinner","description_or":"Falling turkey and Brussels sprout prices mean Christmas dinner will cost a little less at the supermarket checkout this year. The price of Brussels sprouts has fallen by 12%, while a 10lb (4.55kg) frozen turkey will cost you £1.21 less than it did last year, research for the BBC suggests. But digging deeper we discovered root vegetables have gone up in price this year, after wet weather delayed the planting season. When all the trimmings are totted up, a family Christmas is set to cost £31.66 in 2024, down from last year's figure of £32.18. It reflects food prices rising at a slower rate in the past year, as UK inflation has eased. The annual change in price for products across Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda, Morrisons, Aldi and Lidl were measured by Retail tracking platform Assosia.  The crown of the Christmas feast, the turkey, has fallen in price by 6% this year, according to this data. Tom Copas, managing director of Copas Turkeys in Cookham, Berkshire, said the price of turkeys had begun to stabilise after a couple of \"incredibly turbulent\" years that had pushed up the cost of rearing his birds. \"Hence we're seeing incremental changes in prices year on year, rather than dramatic ones,\" added Mr Copas, whose family has been rearing turkeys since 1957. However, Mr Copas says he'd seen slower sales and more demand for smaller turkeys this year, perhaps indicating customers were tightening their belts. \"It's possibly people are trying to keep the overall basket spend down.\" Brussels sprouts came in at 12p cheaper for a 500g bag compared to last year. Hot summers and sudden cold snaps of the previous two years had made things hard for producers, says John Inglis, senior commercial manager at ESG Drysdale, one of the UK's largest sprout producers.  But he says this year has seen us get \"back to normality\" after \"a couple of tricky seasons\" and sprouts are thriving again. The price change may not affect everyone though as the humble sprout can be a divisive veg. A YouGov poll earlier this year found that a quarter of Britons dislike them, with the controversial brassica more popular with older generations. Root vegetables were behind the largest price changes in our Christmas shop. Maris Piper potatoes have seen a whopping 26% increase, with a typical 2kg bag up from £1.58 to £1.99. Tracy Bush, co-director of Provenance Potatoes in Kent, says poor weather has had a lot to do with the price of spuds going up in recent years. \"We've had a particularly wet spring so planting was difficult for any root crops, and then the autumn when crops are lifted and harvested, that was also very difficult,\" she says. Carrot farmer Rodger Hobson says the same wet weather delayed this year's carrot planting season. Last year, the weather was so bad that supermarkets had to import carrots. This year, they've gone up by 13.4% to 69p per kilo. But Mr Hobson says he would not be surprised if \"when it comes to Christmas week they'll be down to 20p a kilo\". This is because carrots are often chosen as \"loss leaders\" in supermarkets. They're sold at a loss to attract customers in to spend on more profitable items. Ged Futter is a retail specialist who used to be a buyer for Asda. He says supermarkets drastically reduce their prices in the week before Christmas.  \"Every year they do the same thing,\" he says, noting that supermarkets usually fight for customers with cut price \"potatoes, carrots, parsnips, Brussels spouts\". Mr Hobson says perishable items make for good loss leaders because customers can't stockpile them when they are cheap. If supermarkets reduced the price of long-life items like baked beans, shoppers might be tempted to buy their year's supply in December, he says. While loss-leaders are good for shoppers, Mr Futter stressed these below-cost prices \"don't show the true cost to the farmer\" and can generate a lot of food waste. \"People think that food is cheap to produce - that's not true.\" This year price rises were not confined to the main meal - the cost of Christmas desserts also went up. Christmas pudding is 11% more expensive than in 2023, and mince pies are up by 5%, according to Assosia's research.  Jessica White, the owner of Meg Rivers artisan bakery, says: \"Our costs have indeed gone up of ingredients, packaging, wages and like everyone - electricity.\" But she says her company had chosen not to put prices up this year. They have already sold out of Christmas puddings and have had to make more to fulfil the waiting list, she says. \"We make more and more each year and don't notice a drop in demand.\" BBC News also looked into how the cost of a Christmas dinner might vary depending on where you shop. We compared prices on the websites of the UK's top five supermarkets - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Morrisons and Aldi. Our snapshot from one day suggests Aldi was the cheapest supermarket for a basic list of Christmas essentials, at around £24.30. Asda was second cheapest at £28.22, followed by Morrisons and Sainsbury's.  Tesco was most expensive at £36.51. Last year, our research suggested Morrisons was the most expensive, with Tesco third. While we tried to find equivalent items across all five supermarkets, there are some small differences in product sizes or types. So the cost of your Christmas dinner might vary between supermarkets and the items you choose. Prices will also vary the closer we get to Christmas as supermarket competition becomes even more fierce. Our BBC analysis should not be directly compared with the price rise figures from retail analysis firm Assosia as we both use a slightly different basket. Start with a budget: Plan ahead and add up hidden expenses, like tin foil for roasting a turkey.

{"_id":{"$oid":"676030d0c3f742fb3373bb46"},"title_or":"Royal Mail takeover by Czech billionaire approved","description_or":"The sale of Royal Mail's parent company to a Czech billionaire has been cleared by the government.  The £3.6bn takeover by Daniel Kretinsky's EP Group has been given the go-ahead after agreeing \"legally binding\" undertakings. The government will retain a so-called \"golden share\" that will require it to approve any major changes to Royal Mail's ownership, HQ location and tax residency. EP Group will also have to maintain the one-price-goes-anywhere Universal Service Obligation (USO), which currently means it has to deliver letters six days per week, Monday to Saturday, and parcels Monday to Friday. The company has committed to maintaining the USO for as long as it owns Royal Mail. Earlier this year, Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he would honour the service - in whatever form it takes - \"for as long as I am alive\". The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\". The regulator said in September that it was looking at these changes, with a decision due next year. Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\". Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\". The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year. When debts are included, the deal values the company at £5.3bn. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said while it was up to shareholders to approve the deal, the agreement the government had reached meant the takeover \"will be a good deal for the UK, be a good deal for the people who work for Royal Mail and a good deal for customers\". Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings. He added, that EP Group had a \"mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers\". The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years. It has also reached an agreement in principle with unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run. Dave Ward, the general secretary of the CWU union, told the BBC it was an \"extensive agreement\" and the deal was the \"best opportunity\" to save the future of Royal Mail. However, he added that the union had \"not agreed anything\" on USO reform and there was \"a long way to go\" before that happened. IDS also owns a highly profitable European parcels business called GLS which made over £300m last year. This offset losses at Royal Mail, allowing IDS to report a small profit. By bringing GLS parcel know-how to the UK market, coupled with investment in out-of-home delivery lockers, Mr Kretinsky hopes to build a pan-European logistics business. The hope is that this will enable Royal Mail to claw back market share it has lost in recent years in the profitable and growing parcels business. Mr Kretinsky has a net worth of £6bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury's, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU. Earlier this year the takeover was called in for review under national security laws as Royal Mail is considered vital national infrastructure. But speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago. Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses. The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels. Last week, Royal Mail was fined £10.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail. Ofcom's Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would \"absolutely\" hold Royal Mail to account. Jenny Hall, director of corporate affairs at Royal Mail, told the BBC the company was investing to improve performance, but it was \"really important\" the USO was reformed to reflect consumer trends. She added that Royal Mail would always try to keep postage costs as low as possible, but prices do \"need to reflect the realities of delivering the service\". The price of a second-class stamp, which is currently 85p, is regulated by Ofcom, with the amount Royal Mail can increase it by each year tied to inflation. However, there are no such limits on first-class stamps, and in October Royal Mail pushed the price for first-class mail up by 30p to £1.65, citing \"very real and urgent\" financial challenges for the move.

Sir Chris Wormald has promised a \"rewiring of the way the government works\", in a message to half a million civil servants. Sir Chris, who previously ran the departments for health and education, has taken  charge of the civil service less than two weeks after Sir Keir Starmer claimed \"too many\" officials were \"comfortable in the tepid bath of managed decline\". The FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, has accused the new government of taking an \"astonishing\" and \"really damaging\" approach.  Labour officials entering government for the first time have privately complained that the Whitehall machine is bloated and outdated.  But FDA general secretary Dave Penman said civil servants \"feel a sense of betrayal\" by the prime minister. In his all-staff message, Sir Chris said he was \"deeply honoured\" to take up his new  job, adding it was his role \"to support the prime minister and government to deliver for the country\".  \"The prime minister has been clear that he wants a re-wiring of the way the government works to deliver his recently announced Plan for Change. \"This will require all of us to do things differently - from working much more effectively across departments to taking advantage of the major opportunities technology provides. \"Throughout my career, I have seen the civil service adapt and change to achieve incredible things for the people of the United Kingdom. I know that together we will relish the opportunities the coming years will bring.\" Sir Chris, who is 56, joined the civil service in the Department for Education in 1991, and later headed that department and the Department of Health and Social Care during the Covid pandemic.   He was the most experienced candidate on the final four-person shortlist for the cabinet secretary job.  When his appointment was announced earlier this month, he was praised by former health secretaries Sir Sajid Javid, who called him \"brilliant, and Matt Hancock, who described him as a \"natural reformer\". Dominic Cummings, the former chief adviser to Boris Johnson during the pandemic, took a different view, saying the appointment was a sign \"the Westminster system is totally determined to resist any change and will continue all the things of the past 20 years that have driven us into crisis\".  Sir Chris has replaced Simon Case, who stepped down after just over four years as cabinet secretary on health grounds. He has been undergoing medical treatment for a neurological condition for the past 18 months. Case had at times been a controversial figure, facing scrutiny particularly over his role in the Downing Street parties saga and over messages he exchanged with ministers during the pandemic. Last week, a government source told the BBC that more than 10,000 civil servants' jobs could be cut as part of Labour's push for 5% savings across departments.  Headcount in the civil service topped 513,000 this year, a 33% increase on 2016  and the eighth year in a row that the total has risen, according to the Institute for Government.  Ministers recognised civil service numbers \"have gone up and up, and in reality that is not going to be able to continue,\" the source said.

Bhim Kohli died on 2 September, a day after being attacked at Franklin Park in Braunstone Town while walking his dog Rocky. The girl, who cannot be named because of her age, appeared at Leicester Youth Court - sitting at Leicester Magistrates' Court - earlier and was released on bail. She is next due at Leicester Crown Court on 3 February. A 15-year-old boy has previously been charged with Mr Kohli's murder. He is due to enter a plea at Leicester Crown Court on Wednesday, and a provisional trial date of 17 February has been set. Leicestershire Police said the attack occurred near the park's Bramble Way entrance at about 18:30 BST on 1 September. A post-mortem examination found Mr Kohli died of a neck injury. In a statement, his family described him as \"a loving husband, dad and grandad\". \"Bhim loved to laugh,\" they said. \"He was always very happy and talkative, the joker of the family and always loved to outsmart us with a smile.\" Because of prior police contact with the victim, Leicestershire Police made a voluntary referral to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC). Following further contact with the IOPC, the force then made a mandatory referral. \"We will carry out an assessment to decide what further action may be required from us,\" an IOPC spokesperson added.

{"_id":{"$oid":"676030d0c3f742fb3373bb49"},"title_or":"Social media given 'last chance' to tackle illegal posts","description_or":"Online platforms must begin assessing whether their services expose users to illegal material by 16 March 2025 or face financial punishments as the Online Safety Act (OSA) begins taking effect. Ofcom, the regulator enforcing the UK's internet safety law, published its final codes of practice for how firms should deal with illegal online content on Monday. Platforms have three months to carry out risk assessments identifying potential harms on their services or they could be fined up to 10% of their global turnover. Ofcom head Dame Melanie Dawes told BBC News this was the \"last chance\" for industry to make changes. \"If they don't start to seriously change the way they operate their services, then I think those demands for things like bans for children on social media are going to get more and more vigorous,\" she said. \"I'm asking the industry now to get moving, and if they don't they will be hearing from us with enforcement action from March.\" Under Ofcom's codes, platforms will need to identify if, where and how illegal content might appear on their services and ways they will stop it reaching users According to the OSA, this includes content relating to child sexual abuse material (CSAM), controlling or coercive behaviour, extreme sexual violence, promoting or facilitating suicide and self-harm. But critics say the Act fails to tackle a wide range of harms for children. The Molly Rose Foundation - set up in memory of teenager Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017 after being exposed to self-harm images on social media - said the OSA has \"deep structural issues\". Andy Burrows, its chief executive, said the organisation was \"astonished and disappointed\" by a lack of specific, targeted measures for platforms on dealing with suicide and self-harm material in Ofcom's guidance. \"Robust regulation remains the best way to tackle illegal content, but it simply isn't acceptable for the regulator to take a gradualist approach to immediate threats to life,\" he said. And children's charity the NSPCC has also voiced its concerns.  \"We are deeply concerned that some of the largest services will not be required to take down the most egregious forms of illegal content, including child sexual abuse material,\" said acting chief Maria Neophytou. \"Today's proposals will at best lock in the inertia to act, and at worst create a loophole which means services can evade tackling abuse in private messaging without fear of enforcement.\" The OSA became law in October 2023, following years of wrangling by politicians over its detail and scope, and campaigning by people concerned over the impact of social media on young people. Ofcom began consulting on its illegal content codes that November, and says it has now \"strengthened\" its guidance for tech firms in several areas. Ofcom says its codes include greater clarity around requirements to take down intimate image abuse content, and more guidance on how to identify and remove material related to women being coerced into sex work. It also includes child safety features such as ensuring that social media platforms stop suggesting people befriend children's accounts and warnings about risks of sharing personal information. Certain platforms must also use a technology called hash-matching to detect child sexual abuse material (CSAM) - a requirement that now applies to smaller file hosting and storage sites. Hash matching is where media is given a unique digital signature which can be checked against hashes belonging to known content - in this case, databases of known CSAM. Many large tech firms have already brought in safety measures for teenage users and controls to give parents more oversight of their social media activity in a bid to tackle dangers for teens and pre-empt regulations. For instance, on Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat, users under the age of 18 cannot be discovered in search or messaged by accounts they do not follow. In October, Instagram also started blocking some screenshots in direct messages to try and combat sextortion attempts - which experts have warned are on the rise, often targeting young men. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle said Ofcom's publication of its codes was a \"significant step\" towards the government's aim of making the internet safer for people in the UK. \"These laws mark a fundamental reset in society's expectations of technology companies,\" he said.  \"I expect them to deliver and will be watching closely to make sure they do.\" Concerns have been raised throughout the OSA's journey over its rules applying to a huge number of varied online services - with campaigners also frequently warning about the privacy implications of platform age verification requirements. And parents of children who died after exposure to illegal or harmful content have previously criticised Ofcom for moving at a \"snail's pace\". The regulator's illegal content codes will still need to be approved by parliament before they can come fully into force on 17 March. But platforms are being told now, with the presumption that the codes will have no issue passing through parliament, and firms must have measures in place to prevent users from accessing outlawed material by this date.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy83jdpgw5o","published_time":"2024-12-16T11:53:10.857307Z","author_name":"Liv McMahon","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fc0d/live/7af6fe30-bb80-11ef-b51d-3926bd0ae179.jpg.webp"],"source":"bbc","category":"World","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-16T19:23:10.857Z"}}

She made the remark while commentating for Fox Sports in Brisbane on Sunday after Bumrah got India off to a stunning start with two quick wickets.  Her comment sparked a social media backlash which noted the word's history as a racial slur.   On Monday, Guha apologised on air: \"Yesterday in commentary I used a word that can be interpreted in a number of different ways... I'd like to apologise for any offence caused.\" Guha, who is also a BBC commentator and former England cricketer, had been speaking live on air with colleagues Brett Lee and Allan Border when the controversy happened. \"Bumrah, today: five overs, 2-4. So, that's the tone, and that's what you want from the ex-skipper,\" Lee said. Guha responded: \"Well, he's the MVP, isn't he? [The] most valuable primate, Jasprit Bumrah. He is the one that's going to do all the talking for India, and why so much focus was on him in the build-up to this Test match, and whether he would be fit.\" In her apology on Monday, she said: \"I set myself really high standards when it comes to empathy and respect for others and if you listen to the full transcript, I only meant the highest praise for one of India's greatest players and someone that I admire greatly as well,\" she said. She said she had been \"trying to frame the enormity of his achievements and I have chosen the wrong word and for that I am deeply sorry\". \"As someone who is also of South Asian heritage, I hope people would recognise there was no other intention or malice there,\" she said. Former India coach Ravi Shastri, a fellow Fox Sports commentator, commended her for the apology and urged India to \"move on\".  \"People are entitled to make mistakes. We are all human. To own up and say, 'I'm sorry' … it takes courage. She's done it. \"As far as the Indian team, there is a Test on and they want to focus on the game,\" he said. Bumrah continued his achievements on Monday, taking his sixth wicket of the innings. Allegations of racism are not unheard of in international cricket, while an independent report into cricket published last year found that racism, sexism, classism and elitism were \"widespread\" in the English and Welsh game.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn9gy7938xeo","published_time":"2024-12-16T07:53:11.845553Z","author_name":"Kelly Ng","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0b4e/live/4d79c2c0-bb5e-11ef-9941-6df04cb58452.jpg.webp"],"source":"bbc","category":"Sports","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-16T19:23:11.846Z"}}

Stokes pulled up on the third afternoon of the third Test against New Zealand and will have a scan overnight. The 33-year-old's 36.2 overs in this Test are his most in a single match since June 2022. \"Maybe it's a case that you manage his bowling loads and he doesn't bowl the volume that he's bowled in this game,\" said Trescothick. \"We'll just have to look at how we manage it.\" Along with all-time greats Jacques Kallis and Sir Garfield Sobers, Stokes is among only three all-rounders to have scored at least 6,000 runs and taken more than 200 wickets in Test cricket. For much of 2023 his bowling was hampered by a long-term left-knee injury, upon which he had surgery at the end of that year. He returned to playing a full role as a bowler in the England side, but this latest problem is the second injury to his left hamstring in five months. The first was sustained playing in The Hundred in August, causing Stokes to miss four Tests. Stokes blow compounds England slide towards defeat England strike on stroke of lunch to leave SA 113-2 Again appearing to be at full fitness in New Zealand, the 66.1 overs he has bowled in this series are his most as captain. The 23 overs he sent down on the first day of the third Test in Hamilton are the most he has bowled in a single day. \"It's always challenging when it's in the same area as before,\" former England opener Trescothick told BBC Sport.  \"Is it the same injury? We don't know. Until we get those scan results we're not going to know.\" Stokes was bowling his third over of the third day when he felt the injury in his hamstring and immediately left the field. Unlike the issue in The Hundred, when Stokes was helped off the field at Old Trafford, he was able to leave under his own steam. He did not appear for the rest of the New Zealand second innings, as the home side piled on 453 to set England an improbable 658 to win. The tourists slipped to 18-2 by the close. Following play, Stokes limped away from the England dressing room with his hamstring strapped. \"Naturally, he was upset,\" said Trescothick. \"That has calmed down a little bit now. He's done plenty of icing, and seen the doctors and the physio. He'll get advice, then hopefully that makes a decision for him.\" Stokes was due to play for MI Cape Town in the SA T20 in January, a stint that now looks in severe doubt. The slim chance that Stokes may have been chosen to play for England in the Champions Trophy also looks to be over. England's next Test is not until May, when they host Zimbabwe for a one-off four-day match at Trent Bridge.

Rapid said the 35-year-old is expected to be out of action for several months after suffering the \"serious head injury\" at the weekend. They say the former Cardiff City forward was attacked by an \"unknown man\" and fractured his skull as he fell following a \"brutal blow\".

{"_id":{"$oid":"676030d0c3f742fb3373bb4f"},"title_or":"PGA Tour v LIV - why the 'Showdown' is significant","description_or":"Rory McIlroy and Scottie Scheffler will take on Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka in Las Vegas A supposed peace deadline had just passed and men's professional golf was mired in more uncertainty, when the idea to create a match between PGA Tour players and those from the breakaway LIV circuit was first pitched. The initial approach, by TV producer Bryan Zuriff, was made to the Rory McIlroy camp in Dubai last January. Zuriff was responsible for previous iterations of 'The Match' - televised silly season clashes for cash. But this concept seemed to carry more significance. McIlroy certainly saw it that way as did three of his most notable peers, which is why 'The Showdown' comes to fruition in Las Vegas on Tuesday. McIlroy partners world number one Scottie Scheffler against LIV recruits Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka. For once, this is a confected contest tasty enough to be worth watching. Scheffler equals record for most wins in a year Scheffler matches Woods with third PGA Tour award  PGA versus LIV - the establishment against the upstarts and McIlroy against DeChambeau - the man who capitalised on the Northern Irish star's US Open capitulation last June. Scheffler competes fresh from reminding us of his prowess with victory in the Bahamas last week, while DeChambeau and 2023 US PGA Championship winner Koepka are past sworn enemies now united as the only players to land majors while playing under the LIV umbrella. These are attractive storylines and this is the first time since The Open in high summer that this quartet of superstars have all been able to play in the same event.  If you wanted to put on a match, these are the four players you would want, which is telling, because professional golf remains a fractured, split sport. But this week's competition is the vehicle to demonstrate that some of the biggest names have had enough of an increasingly tedious and debilitating divide. Last week McIlroy was asked whether this event would serve as a detrimental reminder that men's professional golf is still a sport at war. The world number three thought it was \"a terrible question\", but it did yield an interesting response. \"We're trying to bring these players together, and the more opportunities we can get to do that, the better,\" McIlroy said. \"Does it remind people we're not playing together all the time? Yes. But at least we're making the effort to try to bring the best together more often. If we can start by doing something like this, that's only a good thing.\" He is saying, in other words, that the stars are taking this into their own hands to make an influential push to end the stalemate. This is another example of how the power of leading players has increased while rival factions have been battling for the game's future. Scheffler weighed in by saying: \"There's been so much talk about LIV versus the PGA Tour, all this talk about money. We want to get back to the competition. It's fun to get together to compete.\" It is fair to say the PGA Tour was lukewarm about two of its most prominent members' involvement in competing against a pair of LIV stars, who remain suspended from the tour for joining the Saudi Arabia funded league. Significantly this match occurs in a week when there is no conflicting PGA Tour tournament. \"It took a few conversations to get them to the point where they saw that this could be a good thing in the long run,\" McIlroy admitted. \"It wasn't all plain sailing, but we got there in the end.\" PGA Tour boss Jay Monahan and his board continue negotiations with the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) over a reported acquisition of six percent of the tour's commercial arm by the PIF. This is the deal that is now almost a year past its initial deadline, but it could still herald peace in golf's so called 'civil war'. If Saudi Arabia becomes formally invested in both sides, LIV and PGA Tour players being reunited at tournaments beyond the majors is a more likely scenario. But until a contract is signed and receives US government approval, we have only a handful of DP World Tour events where LIV recruits have been welcomed and this week's 'Showdown' at Shadow Creek as opportunities to see together golfers from the conflicted constituencies. The players will be mic'd up, but the golf should do the talking because there are enough ingredients to give the contest a degree of edge which has been missing from previous iterations. Genuine interaction between the players will be fascinating to hear. We do not need faux banter that can so often infect this kind of occasion and hopefully the players will remember they are golfers rather than comedians. It is no joke to say that this is possibly a glance into the future and not just because the spoils are coming in the form of Crypto currency. The LIV camp is already talking up an enticing prospect of a Ryder Cup style match between the rival tours. It is a concept that could excite fans and maybe replace the moribund Presidents Cup put on in non-Ryder years by the PGA Tour, which is contested by teams representing the US and non-European internationals and is not open to LIV golfers. Such developments in pro golf do not tend to happen in a hurry, though. Nevertheless, the fact that this week's contest is occurring at all is a start. And through its relative competitive validity it is, maybe, a significant step towards some kind of reconciliation.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/c1el0y158g8o","published_time":"2024-12-16T13:45:19.907370Z","author_name":"","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1200/cpsprodpb/fca6/live/8ccc0b50-bbb2-11ef-9dde-6380fe4ea45e.jpg"],"source":"bbc","category":"World","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-16T19:23:19.908Z"}}

It is Monday, 30 June 2025 and we have just had this report from Wimbledon. \"The defending ladies' champion was the first player to walk out on to Centre Court this year, as The All England Club joined the other Grand Slams in a year of significant change. \"Men have joined women in playing best-of-three sets in the first four rounds of a major, with all singles played over five sets from the quarter-finals onwards. \"Change at this year’s Australian Open was well received.

What being coached by Murray could do for Djokovic There is a long standing tradition of the men's singles final taking place on the last Sunday of a Grand Slam - and up until 1981, the women's Wimbledon final took place on a Friday. A men's final on a Sunday allows for both semi-finals to be played on a Friday, ensuring no-one should have to play five-set matches on consecutive days. But if men get to end the tournament, then why are women not invited to raise the Centre Court curtain on the opening Monday? Tradition should not be used as a reason to maintain the status quo, as the All England Club has already announced next year's singles finals will start at the later time of 16:00 to attract the largest possible worldwide audience.  This debate causes me a lot of anguish. With matches getting longer, I just do not feel it is sustainable for either players or TV audiences if early-round matches regularly stretch to four or five hours. Playing the first four rounds of the men's singles over three sets rather than five would, I know, deprive us of the odd Grand Slam classic. There would perhaps be a few more upsets, but the top players are more than capable of bringing that intensity from game one. As the Olympics and various tour finals have shown, three-set matches can be utterly compelling.  I would suggest reverting to five sets from the quarter-finals onwards, and offering women the same opportunity. Changing the format halfway through does not seem an issue to me. Footballers sometimes need to play half-an-hour of extra time, cricketers switch between T20 matches and five-day Tests, and you need 10 frames to win a first-round World Snooker Championships match - but 18 to win the final.  Daniil Medvedev thanked fans for staying until nearly 4am at the Australian Open - but said he himself would have been long asleep Players have been talking about the physical and mental impact of late finishes for years. The ATP and WTA Tour have jointly brought in a new rule which means no matches should start after 11pm - but there are loopholes, and that does not apply to the four majors. Daniil Medvedev and Emil Ruusuvuori played until 3.40am at this year’s Australian Open, despite Tennis Australia starting the tournament a day earlier to \"deliver a solution to minimise late finishes\". This year's US Open saw a record latest finish for a women's match in the event's history, and a men's match which finished even later., external If these two Slams want to continue to stage both a women's and a men's match in the night session, with the possibility of eight sets of tennis, then they cannot start at 7pm. A 5pm start may cause issues with the TV evening news bulletin, and some inconvenience for those who live close and are hoping to do a full day's work beforehand, but it would dramatically reduce the number of post-midnight finishes. A mixed team World Cup should be created so that top players approach it the same way they do a Grand Slam, and withdraw only as a last resort. The timing of this is so important. The finals of team competitions should no longer be in November, when players' bodies feel broken and they know they have barely a month before a new season begins. Late September would be perfect, even if events like the Laver Cup have to move back in the calendar. The Davis and Billie Jean King Cups have a proud history, with the men's event dating back to 1900, but a mixed finals involving 16 teams would be an important step towards maintaining the prestige of the competitions. Why not try a random, FA Cup-style draw in which there are no seeds for each round? An October finish would be welcomed by many, but there would still be a chance to experiment once the Grand Slam season is done. Why should virtually every ATP and WTA event follow the same format? Holding indoor events in Europe with smaller fields later in the season presents an opportunity to experiment and attract attention that could otherwise move elsewhere. Seedings are a way of protecting the top players - and a tournament director’s investment in them - but why not try a random FA Cup-style draw before each round?  Or, why not play the first to four games, as featured at the Next Gen ATP Finals? Scrap lets and watch a player scramble to reach a net affected serve? Or demand a player hit their own serve even if the ball toss goes awry? What's the harm in trying?","url":"https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/articles/c30nlr8lr8qo","published_time":"2024-12-16T07:53:20.566380Z","author_name":"","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/3840/cpsprodpb/8bd1/live/67660bf0-b319-11ef-aff0-072ce821b6ab.jpg","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/3840/cpsprodpb/9a02/live/bcbd7830-b31a-11ef-a0f2-fd81ae5962f4.jpg","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/3840/cpsprodpb/a235/live/ef6660f0-b6d8-11ef-a0f2-fd81ae5962f4.jpg"],"source":"bbc","category":"Technology","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-16T19:23:20.567Z"}}
{"_id":{"$oid":"6762a166c3f742fb3373bb51"},"title_or":"UK inflation rate hits highest level for eight months","description_or":"The UK inflation rate has gone up for the second month in a row, with prices rising at their fastest pace since March. Inflation hit 2.6% in the year to November, according to official figures. Fuel and clothing were among the main drivers behind the rise. Increasing ticket prices for gigs and plays were also a factor. Analysts say the latest figures mean the Bank of England will almost certainly not cut interest rates when it meets this week. \"Inflation rose again this month as prices of motor fuel and clothing increased this year but fell a year ago,\" said Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which gathered the data. \"This was partially offset by air fares, which traditionally dip at this time of year, but saw their largest drop in November since records began at the start of the century.\" Chancellor Rachel Reeves said she recognised that families were still struggling with the cost of living. \"Today's figures are a reminder that for too long the economy has not worked for working people.\" \"I am fighting to put more money in the pockets of working people.\" Inflation, while higher than earlier in the year, is well below its peak in late 2022.  It has fallen steadily over the past two years and undershot the Bank of England's 2% target in September, before rising again in October. The official forecasting body said in October that inflation was likely to pick up to 2.6% in 2025 in part due to the impact of Budget measures announced in October. Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said: \"The chancellor has made a series of irresponsible and inflationary decisions.\" \"These figures mean higher costs in the shops, less money in working people's pockets and risks keeping mortgage rates higher for longer,\" he said. Prices for food and non-alcoholic drinks, alcohol and tobacco, and footwear all rose at a faster pace last month. A wider measure of inflation showed housing and household services costs, including rent, rose by 3.5% Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at the financial services firm, Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Inflation is staying put for now, like an unwelcome Christmas party guest hogging the sofa into the small hours. \"The question is whether it can be shifted, or if it's going to hang around to ruin our plans for months – eating us out of house and home and driving up the cost of everything again,\" she said. Businesses like Miller's Fish and Chips, in Haxby, Yorkshire, are also feeling the pressure from rising prices. \"It's been a tough year\" said David Miller. \"We've taken a hit with our bottom line because of fuel, obviously the utilities going up.\" \"But I think the biggest thing overall for any business is wages,\" he said. Miller's employs 60 people and tries to pay above the minimum wage. Wage costs for businesses will rise again in April, after measures announced in October's Budget come into force. The Bank of England will have to weigh up competing arguments over whether to cut interest rates. Recent figures show the economy shrank in September and October, and the usual response would be to lower interest rates.  That would ease the pressure on mortgage-holders and other borrowers, including businesses and should boost spending and investment. However, rising prices, combined with figures on Tuesday that showed faster growth in wages, suggest rates may need to remain at their current 4.75% for longer, to keep inflation in check. Many economists now expect interest rates to fall more slowly next year than had been expected previously. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at the think tank, Capital Economics, said November's higher inflation figure made it very unlikely interest rates would be cut on Thursday. \"There is almost no chance of the Bank of England delivering an early Christmas present with another interest rate cut tomorrow, \" he said. \"That's especially the case since domestic inflation pressures appear to be a touch stronger than the Bank expected.\" Capital Economics predicts inflation will dip in December and then rise again in January, but by the end of next year would have fallen back to close to the Bank of England's 2% target.

{"_id":{"$oid":"6762a166c3f742fb3373bb52"},"title_or":"Tens of thousands face Winter Fuel Payment delay","description_or":"Tens of thousands of pensioners are unlikely to receive their Winter Fuel Payments before the end of the year as the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has been grappling with a growing backlog of new claims for Pension Credit, analysis by BBC Verify suggests.  There has been a surge in applications for Pension Credit since Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced in July that Winter Fuel Payments for this year would be mainly limited to those receiving Pension Credit. There was a backlog of 90,000 unprocessed claims as of mid-November with around 9,000 being processed each week, according to the latest official figures. With a likely similar amount of new applications each week since then, there is a  risk that there will still be a backlog of tens of thousands by the end of the year. The DWP said it had deployed 500 additional staff to speed up processing. Gary Jameson in Oxford applied for Pension Credit in early September, well in advance of his 66th birthday, so he wouldn't lose out when his disability benefits stopped. But his birthday has been and gone and he has still not had a decision. \"I'm having to transfer money from my own private savings, which are not very much anyway,\" he told BBC Verify. He was originally told it would take six to 10 weeks to process his claim, \"but I think with all the delays it will probably be months,\" he added. On 18 December, MPs are launching an inquiry into how changes to the Winter Fuel Payment are affecting pensioner poverty. Before the chancellor's announcement on 29 July, the average number of weekly applications in the UK for Pension Credit, where the government tops up a pensioner's income, was 3,800.  Since August, it's been averaging around 9,400 following campaigns by the government and charities, encouraging people to claim. The DWP has released data showing there were around 150,000 new applications for Pension Credit in the UK between 29 July and 17 November. However, the Pensions Minister, Emma Reynolds, told Parliament on 4 December that the total number of unprocessed Pension Credit applications in the end of week commencing 18th November was 91,075. Not all applications, once processed, are successful and get awarded Pension Credit - around 45% of applications processed since 29 July have been approved. BBC Verify heard from Simon Livingston in Brighton, who told us he had applied for Pension Credit for his mother in March and was still waiting for a decision. And Jackie Newberry in Hook in Hampshire applied for Pension Credit for her 95-year-old mother Ena in February and was told she would get a decision by mid-March. After chasing several times she was finally told her claim had been approved in early December.  DWP data shows that in the week of 18 November, the average processing time for a Pension Credit application was 65 working days, or 13 weeks, up from 9 weeks at the end of July. That average processing time, unless it has picked up, would mean eligible people who submitted an application in November or December would likely not receive their £200 to £300 Winter Fuel Payment - and backdated Pension Credit payment -  until February or March 2025. The former pensions minister, Steve Webb, who is now a partner at pension consultants LCP said: \"Although they will eventually receive arrears once Pension Credit comes into payment, including any Winter Fuel Payment to which they would have been entitled, most who were on the waiting list by mid November are likely to have to manage through Christmas and the New Year on a very modest income until their claim is processed\". A government spokesperson said: \"Over a million pensioners will still receive the Winter Fuel Payment, and our drive to boost Pension Credit take up has seen applications more than double with over 40,000 more pensioners now receiving it, as well as the Winter Fuel Payment.\"  \"We have deployed additional staff to support processing applications, seeing a 51% increase in the number of cleared claims since the Chancellor's announcement.\" The Scottish government has announced that from late 2025 every Scottish pensioner household will receive a winter fuel payment. The numbers in the UK at risk of delayed payments this year are uncertain because it depends on the rate at which DWP officials are working through the backlog. The DWP data does point to a significant pick up in the rate at which claims are being processed. In August, it was processing around 4,500 claims per week. In the first half of November, it was getting through an average of around 9,000. However, the official backlog figures only go up to the middle of November. There are likely to have been tens of thousands more applications since then. BBC Verify asked the DWP for the most up-to-date figures for the size of the backlog and the average processing time and they pointed us to the published figures from the middle of November. The government has set 21 December as the deadline by which eligible people can apply for Pension Credit in time to receive the 2024-25 Winter Fuel Payment. In 2022, only 63% of those eligible for Pension Credit are estimated by DWP to have claimed it. After the means-testing of the Winter Fuel Payment was announced in July, the government estimated its awareness campaign would push the take-up rate to 68% - equivalent to an additional 100,000 people. However, this would still leave roughly 780,000 eligible pensioners who would not be receiving either the Pension Credit or Winter Fuel Payment to which they are entitled because they have not applied.

{"_id":{"$oid":"6762a166c3f742fb3373bb53"},"title_or":"Russia detains Uzbek man over general's killing in Moscow","description_or":"Russia's security service says a 29-year-old man from Uzbekistan has been detained over the killing of senior general Igor Kirillov and his assistant in Moscow. Lt Gen Igor Kirillov, head of the Radiation, Chemical and Biological Protection Forces, was outside a residential block early on Tuesday when an explosive device hidden in a scooter was detonated remotely. The Russian security service said the unnamed suspect was recruited by Ukrainian intelligence, according to state media agencies. Ukraine's security service had already claimed it was behind the killing, a source told the BBC on Tuesday. The Ukrainian source said Kirillov - who was Russia's chemical weapons chief - was \"a legitimate target\" and alleged he had carried out war crimes. On Monday, the day before the killing, Ukraine charged Kirillov, 54, in absentia, saying he was \"responsible for the mass use of banned chemical weapons\". Russia denies the allegations. The Russian Federal Security Service's (FSB) public relations centre said on Wednesday the detained 29-year-old was \"suspected of committing a terrorist act\". A statement said that during \"interrogation he explained that he was recruited by the Ukrainian special services\". In a video published by the FSB, the purported suspect - a dark-haired man wearing handcuffs with what appears to be a visible rip in his coat - speaks directly to the camera. He appears to say he was offered a reward of $100,000 and permission to move to the European Union in exchange for killing Kirillov. The FSB added that on Ukraine's instructions, he arrived in Moscow and received a homemade explosive device. He placed the explosive device on an electric scooter, which he parked at the entrance to the residential building where Kirillov lived, the FSB said. He then rented a car to monitor Kirillov's residence and installed a camera on the dashboard which livestreamed a video feed to handlers in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, the statement added. When they saw Kirillov emerge from the house, the suspect was told to press the button and detonate the bomb, the FSB said. Kirillov is thought to be the most senior military figure assassinated inside Russia since the country invaded Ukraine nearly three years ago.  Alongside being charged by Ukraine, the 54-year-old had previously been sanctioned by the UK over the alleged use of chemical weapons in Ukraine.  Ukraine's SBU security service has claimed Russia used chemical weapons more than 4,800 times under the general's leadership. Moscow denies this, and says it destroyed the last remainder of its vast chemical weapons stockpile in 2017. Pictures from the scene outside Kirillov's apartment block in south-eastern Moscow on Tuesday showed the badly damaged entrance, with scorch marks on the walls and a number of windows blown out. Two body bags could also be seen on the street. Also on Wednesday, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Russia would raise Kirillov's assassination at the meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Friday. Russian officials have vowed to find and punish those involved in the killing.

{"_id":{"$oid":"6762a166c3f742fb3373bb54"},"title_or":"How Facebook restricted news out of Gaza","description_or":"Facebook has severely restricted the ability of Palestinian news outlets to reach an audience during the Israel-Gaza war, according to BBC research. In a comprehensive analysis of Facebook data, we found that newsrooms in the Palestinian territories - in Gaza and the West Bank - had suffered a steep drop in audience engagement since October 2023. The BBC has also seen leaked documents showing that Instagram - another Meta-owned platform - increased its moderation of Palestinian user comments after October 2023. Meta - the owner of Facebook - says that any implication that it deliberately suppressed particular voices is \"unequivocally false\". Since the beginning of the Israel-Gaza war, just a few outside reporters have been allowed to enter the Palestinian coastal territory of Gaza from the outside, and they were only able to do so escorted by the Israeli army. Social media has filled the gap for those wanting to hear more voices from inside Gaza. Facebook pages for news outlets such as Palestine TV, Wafa news agency and Palestinian Al-Watan News - which operate out of the West Bank territory - became a vital source of updates for many around the world. BBC News Arabic compiled engagement data on the Facebook pages of 20 prominent Palestinian-based news organisations in the year leading up to the 7 October Hamas attacks on Israel, and in the year since. Engagement is a key measure of how much impact a social media account is having and how many people are seeing its content. It includes such factors as the number of comments, reactions and shares. During a period of war, audience engagement might be expected to rise. However, the data showed a 77% decline after the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023. Palestine TV has 5.8 million followers on Facebook. Journalists at the newsroom shared statistics with us showing a 60% drop in the number of people seeing their posts. \"Interaction was completely restricted, and our posts stopped reaching people,\" says Tariq Ziad, a journalist at the channel. Over the past year, Palestinian journalists have raised fears that their online content is being \"shadow-banned\" by Meta - in other words, restricted in how many people see it. To test this, we carried out the same data analysis on the Facebook pages of 20 Israeli news organisations such as Yediot Ahronot, Israel Hayom and Channel 13. These pages also posted a large amount of war-related content, but their audience engagement increased by nearly 37%. Meta has previously been accused by Palestinians and human rights groups of failing to moderate online activity fairly. An independent report in 2021 commissioned by the company said this was not deliberate but because of a lack of Arabic-speaking expertise among moderators. Words and phrases were being interpreted as offensive or violent, when they were in fact innocuous. For example, the Arabic phrase \"Alhamdulillah\", which means \"Praise be to God\", was sometimes being auto-translated as \"Praise be to God, Palestinian terrorists are fighting for their freedom\". To see if this explained the decline in engagement with Palestinian outlets, the BBC carried out the same analysis on Facebook pages for 30 prominent Arabic-language news sources based elsewhere, such as Sky News Arabia and Al-Jazeera. However, these pages saw an average increase in engagement of nearly 100%. Responding to our research, Meta pointed out that it had made no secret of \"temporary product and policy measures\" taken in October 2023. It said it had faced a challenge balancing the right to freedom of speech, with the fact that Hamas was both US-sanctioned and designated as a dangerous organisation under Meta's own policies. The tech giant also said that pages posting exclusively about the war were more likely to see engagement impacted. \"We acknowledge we make mistakes, but any implication that we deliberately suppress a particular voice is unequivocally false,\" a spokesperson said. The BBC has also spoken to five former and current employees of Meta about the impact they say their company's policies have had on individual Palestinian users. One person, who spoke anonymously, shared leaked internal documents about a change made to Instagram's algorithm, which toughened the moderation of Palestinians commenting on Instagram posts. \"Within a week of the Hamas attack, the code was changed essentially making it more aggressive towards Palestinian people,\" he said. Internal messages show that an engineer raised concerns about the order, worried that it could be \"introducing a new bias into the system against Palestinian users\". Meta confirmed it took the measure but said it had been necessary to respond to what it called a \"spike in hateful content\" coming out of the Palestinian territories. It said that policy changes put in place at the start of the Israel-Gaza war had now been reversed, but did not say when this happened. At least 137 Palestinian journalists are reported to have been killed in Gaza since the beginning of the conflict, but a few carry on despite the dangers. \"A lot of information can't be published as it is too graphic - for example if the [Israeli] army commits a massacre and we film it, the video won't spread,\" says Omar el Qataa, one of the few photojournalists who chose to stay in northern Gaza. \"But in spite of the challenges, the risks, and the content bans,\" he says,\"we must continue sharing Palestinian content.\" Additional reporting by Rehab Ismail and Natalie Merzougui","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c786wlxz4jgo","published_time":"2024-12-18T00:17:35.476389Z","author_name":"Ahmed Nour, Joe Tidy and Yara Farag","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/75d2/live/9a4ab640-bb9a-11ef-a2ca-e99d0c9a24e3.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0840/live/1a6d8530-bb8e-11ef-aff0-072ce821b6ab.png.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/543a/live/31db4ae0-bb8e-11ef-a2ca-e99d0c9a24e3.png.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0194/live/587c8380-bb8e-11ef-a2ca-e99d0c9a24e3.png.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9468/live/58cd6d30-bb8f-11ef-a0f2-fd81ae5962f4.jpg.webp"],"source":"bbc","category":"World","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-18T15:47:35.476Z"}}
{"_id":{"$oid":"6762a166c3f742fb3373bb55"},"title_or":"'She was full of life', dad of teen who died in Laos poisonings tells BBC","description_or":"The father of 19-year-old Holly Bowles, who died of suspected methanol poisoning in Laos last month, has said he was in \"disbelief\" when he realised his daughter would not pull through. Speaking to the BBC, Shaun Bowles described Holly as \"everything you'd want your daughter to be\".  The Australian teenager had been travelling across South East Asia with her best friend Bianca Jones when they fell ill after drinking alcohol thought to be contaminated with methanol, a toxic substance sometimes added to bootleg drinks.  They were among six foreign tourists to die over a few days in the small, riverside tourist town of Vang Vieng. \"They were having an unbelievable time, just having so much fun, doing what two 19-year-old girls should be doing,\" Shaun Bowles told the BBC's Today Programme. The grieving process, he said, has been made more manageable by the fact that he is \"best friends\" with Bianca's father, Mark. Together, Mark and Shaun had travelled through Thailand on their own backpacking trip 25 years ago. \"It's just bizarre to be going through the same thing with your best friend. Just being together and just talking helps us get through the days,\" he said.  Holly and Bianca had planned their trip to celebrate their graduation from school.  Since they'd been away, Shaun had spoken to his daughter every few days, while Holly's mother, Sam, had spoken to her \"every second\". \"They were just having an absolute blast,\" he said.   The two teenagers were taken to hospital after they failed to check out of the Nana Backpacker hostel, where they were staying, and were found unresponsive.  Shaun and his family received news they were unwell through a friend - and the two mothers flew out to Thailand that night. \"When you're getting second hand information... it was really hard to process exactly what sort of condition that they were in,\" said Shaun.  He and Bianca's father, Mark, flew out the next day, by which point the girls were in a hospital in Udon Thani, over the border from Laos in Thailand. Bianca died on 21 November, and Holly a day later. \"She was just full of life. She was confident, she was loving, she was just a true friend of people. She was everything you want your daughter to be,\" said Shaun.  Now, Shaun says, his focus is on raising awareness of methanol poisoning to other young people backpacking through South East Asia. \"We absolutely want whoever is responsible for this brought to account and brought to justice, and we're going to do everything that we can to make sure that is the case,\" he says. The other four victims have been named as Simone White, a 28-year-old lawyer from the UK; James Louis Hutson, a 57-year-old American; and Danish citizens Anne-Sofie Orkild Coyman, 20, and Freja Vennervald Sorensen, 21. Eight people have been arrested in connection with the case.

{"_id":{"$oid":"6762a166c3f742fb3373bb56"},"title_or":"The ordinary woman who has shaken attitudes to rape in France","description_or":"Warning: This story contains descriptions of sexual abuse. Each morning, the queues began forming before dawn. Groups of women – always women – stood in the autumn chill on a pavement beside a busy ring road, outside Avignon's glass and concrete courthouse. They came, day after day. Some brought flowers. All wanted to be in place to applaud Gisèle Pelicot as she walked, purposefully, up the steps and through the glass doors. Some dared to approach her. A few shouted: \"We're with you, Gisèle,\" and \"Be brave.\" Most then stayed on, hoping to secure seats in the courthouse's public overflow room from where they could watch proceedings on a television screen. They were there to bear witness to the courage of a grandmother, as she sat quietly in court, surrounded by dozens of her rapists. \"I see myself in her,\" said Isabelle Munier, 54. \"One of the men on trial was once a friend of mine. It's disgusting.\" \"She's become a figurehead for feminism,\" said Sadjia Djimli, 20. But they came for other reasons too. Above all, it seemed, they were looking for answers. As France digests the implications of its largest rape trial, which is due to end this week, it's clear that many French women – and not just those at the courthouse in Avignon – are pondering two fundamental questions. The first question is visceral. What might it say about French men – some would say all men – that 50 of them, in one small, rural neighbourhood, were apparently willing to accept a casual invitation to have sex with an unknown woman as she lay, unconscious, in a stranger's bedroom? The second question emerges from the first: how far will this trial go in helping to tackle an epidemic of sexual violence and of drug-facilitated rape, and in challenging deeply held prejudices and ignorance about shame and consent? Put simply, will Gisèle Pelicot's courageous stand and her determination – as she has put it, to make \"shame swap sides\" from the victim to the rapist – change anything? A long trial creates its own microclimate and, over the past weeks, a strange sort of normality developed inside Avignon's Palais de Justice. Amid the TV cameras and the huddles of lawyers, the sight of dozens of alleged rapists – faces not always hidden behind masks – no longer provoked the shock it had at the start. The accused strolled around, chatting, joking, grabbing coffee from the machine or returning from a café across the road, and, in the process, somehow emphasised the core argument of their various defence strategies: that these were just regular guys, a cross-section of French society, who were looking for a \"swinging\" adventure online and got caught up in something unexpected. \"[That argument is] the most shocking thing about this case. It's harrowing to think about it,\" says Elsa Labouret, who works for a French activist group, Dare to be Feminist.  \"I think most people in long-term relationships with men think of their partner as someone trustworthy. But now there's this sense of identification [with Gisèle Pelicot] for a lot of women. Like, 'okay, so that can happen to me'. \"These are not criminal masterminds,\" she continues. \"They just went on the internet... So, it is possible similar things are happening everywhere.\" It's a view widely held, but also widely contested in France. France's Institute of Public Policies released figures in 2024 showing that on average, 86% of complaints of sexual abuse and 94% of rapes were either not prosecuted or never came to a trial, in the period between 2012 and 2021. Ms Labouret argues that sexual violence happens when certain men know that they \"can get away with it. And I think that's a big reason why it's so rampant in France.\" Throughout the four-month trial, at the end of each courtroom break, the accused would gather by the metal detector before muscling past the mostly female press corps, also waiting to enter the chamber. Inside, one by one, the men took their turn to share their accounts. A court-appointed psychiatrist Laurent Layet testified that the accused were neither \"monsters\" nor \"ordinary men\". Some wept. A few confessed. But most offered an array of excuses, with many saying they were simply \"libertines\" – as the French put it – indulging a couple's fantasies, and that they had no way of knowing Ms Pelicot had not consented. Others claimed Dominique Pelicot had intimidated them. There are very few clear patterns or shared characteristics among the 51 men on trial. They represent a wide spectrum in society: three-quarters have children. Half are married or in a relationship. Just over a quarter of them said they had been abused or raped as children. There is no discernible grouping by age or job or social class. The two traits they all share are that they're male, and that they made contact on an illicit online chat forum called Coco, known for catering to swingers, as well as attracting paedophiles and drug dealers. According to French prosecutors, the site, which was shut down earlier this year, has been cited in more than 23,000 reports of criminal activity. The BBC has found that 23 of those on trial – or 45% – had previous criminal convictions. Although the authorities do not collect precise data, according to some estimates that is approximately four times the national average in France. \"There's no typical profile of men who commit sexual violence,\" concluded Labouret. One person who has followed the case more closely than most is Juliette Campion, a French journalist who has been in court throughout the trial to report for the public broadcaster France Info. \"I think this case could have happened in other countries, of course. But I think it says a lot about how men see women in France… About the notion of consent,\" she says. \"A lot of men don't know what consent actually is, so [the case] says a lot about our country, sadly.\" The Pelicot case is certainly helping to shape the contours of attitudes to rape across France. On 21 September, a group of prominent French men, including actors, singers, musicians and journalists, wrote a public letter that was published in Liberation newspaper, arguing that the Pelicot case proved that male violence \"is not a matter of monsters\". \"It is a matter of men, of Mr Everyman,\" the letter said. \"All men, without exception, benefit from a system that dominates women.\" It also sketched out a \"road map\" for men seeking to challenge the patriarchy, with advice such as \"let's stop thinking there is a masculine nature that justifies our behaviour\". Some experts believe the huge public interest in the Pelicot case could already be producing benefits. \"This whole case is so useful for everyone, for all generations, for young boys, for young girls, for adults,\" says Karen Noblinski, a Paris-based lawyer specialising in sexual assault cases. \"It has raised awareness in young people. Rape doesn't always happen in a bar, in a club. It can happen in our home.\" But there is clearly much more work to be done. I went to meet Louis Bonnet, who is the mayor of the Pelicots' home village, Mazan, early on in the trial. Although he was unequivocal in condemning the alleged rapes, he stated clearly and twice that he felt Gisèle Pelicot's experience had been overblown, and argued that as she'd been unconscious, she had suffered less than other rape victims. \"Yes, I am minimising it, because I think it could have been much worse,\" he said at the time. \"When there are kids involved, or women killed, then that is very serious because you can't go back. In this case, the family will have to rebuild itself. It will be hard, but no one died. So, they can still do it.\" Bonnet's comments provoked outrage across France. The Mayor later issued a statement, expressing his \"sincere apologies\". Online, many of the debates around the case have focused on the controversial suggestion that \"all men\" are capable of rape. There's no evidence to support such a claim. Some men have pushed back against the argument, using the hashtag #NotAllMen. \"We do not ask other women to bear the 'shame' of women who behave badly, why should the mere fact of being a man qualify us to bear the shame?\" asked one man on social media. But the pushback was swift. Women reacted to the #NotAllMen hashtag with anger and, sometimes, with details of their own abuse. \"The hashtag has been created by men and used by men. It's a way to silence the suffering of women,\" wrote journalist Manon Mariani. Later, a male musician and influencer, Waxx, added his own criticism, telling the hashtag users to \"shut up once and for all. It's not about you, it's about us. Men kill. Men attack. Period.\" Elsa Labouret believes French attitudes still need challenging. \"I think a lot of people still think that sexual violence is sexy or romantic or something that is part of the way that we do things here [in France],\" she argues. \"And it's so important that we question that and that we don't accept this kind of argument at all.\" In her small office just behind the French parliament building on the River Seine, Sandrine Josso, an MP, has a four-letter swearword on a poster beside her desk. It captures the spirit of defiance and determination that is driving her campaign against what's known in France as \"chemical submission\", or drugging in order to rape. A year ago, in November 2023, she was at a party in the Paris apartment of a senator named Joel Guerriau. She claims that he put a drug in her champagne with the intention of raping her. Guerriau has denied attempting to drug her, blaming a \"handling error\" and telling investigators that the glass had been contaminated a day earlier.  In a statement, his lawyer has said: \"We are miles away from the obscene interpretation that one might infer from reading initial reports in the press.\" A trial is anticipated next year. Josso is now campaigning, as she puts it, to \"make victims' journeys easier\" when it comes to the French legal system. \"Today, it's a disaster. Because very few victims who file complaints are able to have a trial, because of the lack of evidence. [There's not] enough medical, psychological or legal support. We find shortcomings everywhere when it concerns sexual violence.\" Josso has now joined forces with Gisèle Pelicot's daughter, Caroline, to put together a drug-testing kit that could be made available in pharmacies throughout France. It now has government backing for a trial rollout, helped by the publicity generated by the Pelicot case. \"I'm optimistic. The medical world and the French people want shame to change sides [from the victim to the accused],\" says Josso, quoting the phrase made famous by Gisèle Pelicot. But Dr Leila Chaouachi, a chemist and expert at the Paris Addiction Monitoring Centre, says that the trial in Avignon is just one step in a long struggle to make people more aware of drugs and rape. \"It needs to become a real major public health issue that everyone takes seriously, and which forces the authorities to urgently address these issues to improve care for victims. \"It's important for all of us to think about the issue, to consider it a health issue, not just a justice issue. It concerns all of us.\" At present the word \"consent\" is not included in the definition of rape in French laws, so some have argued that it should be changed to make it more explicit. But Ms Noblinski believes the focus should be elsewhere. \"[It] should be on the police, on the investigations, on funding them properly, not on tinkering with the law,\" she says. \"They don't have sufficient resources. They have too many cases, and that's the real issue. When you have too many things to handle, it's very hard to find evidence.\" On her daily commute to the courthouse, during the first weeks of the trial, Gisèle Pelicot walked with her shoulders hunched and her posture defensive. She seemed flustered by the sheer level of interest the case generated. By the closing arguments, however, her demeanour was entirely different and she sat perfectly poised. That has coincided with a greater change: as the trial progressed, the prosecution, those watching – and Mrs Pelicot herself – came to understand the extraordinary impact of her decision to opt not just for an open trial, but for every detail to be shown in court. \"She's showing us that… if you're a victim… do your best not to carry shame. Keep your head high,\" says Elsa Labouret. \"As a woman, you start by being doubted. You start off as a liar and you have to prove that it's true. I don't doubt that every woman has been through something. Something, you know. In that way she represents all the women in the world.  \"[Gisèle Pelicot] decided to make this bigger than herself. To make this about the way that we, as a society, treat sexual violence.\" Emerging from yet another day in the courtroom, the French journalist Juliette Campion stopped to reflect on what impact the case might have. \"It was difficult to see all those videos... As a woman, it's complicated, and I feel tired,\" she says. \"But at least we did our job, and we talked about it. It's a very small step. It won't be a big thing. The only thing I can hope for now is that it will be a game changer for some men.

{"_id":{"$oid":"6762a166c3f742fb3373bb57"},"title_or":"Life in Idlib hints at what Syria can expect from rebel rule","description_or":"The road to Idlib, a remote corner in north-west Syria, still has the signs of the old front lines: trenches, abandoned military positions, rocket shells and ammunition.  Until a little more than a week ago, this was the only area in the country controlled by the opposition. From Idlib, rebels led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, launched an astonishing offensive that toppled Bashar al-Assad and ended his family's five-decade dictatorship in Syria.  As a result, they have become the country's de facto authorities and appear to be trying to bring their way of governing to the rest of Syria. In Idlib's city centre, opposition flags, with a green stripe and three red stars, were flying high in public squares and being waved by men and women, old and young, in the wake of Assad's removal. Graffiti on walls celebrated the resistance against the regime. While destroyed buildings and piles of rubble were a reminder of the not-so-distant war, repaired houses, recently opened shops and well-maintained roads were testament that some things had, indeed, improved. But there were complaints of what was seen as heavy-handed rule by the authorities. When we visited earlier this week, streets were relatively clean, traffic lights and lamp-posts worked, and officers were present in the busiest areas. Simple things absent in other parts of Syria, and a source of pride here. HTS has its origins in al-Qaeda but, in recent years, has actively tried to rebrand itself as a nationalist force, distant from its jihadist past and intent on removing Assad.  As fighters marched to Damascus earlier this month, its leaders spoke about building a Syria for all Syrians. It is, however, still described as a terrorist organisation by the US, the UK, the UN and others, including Turkey, which backs some Syrian rebels. The group took control of most of this region, home to 4.5 million people, in 2017, bringing stability after years of civil war.  The administration, known as the Salvation Government, runs water and electricity distribution, garbage collection and road pavement.  Taxes collected from businesses, farmers and crossings with Turkey fund its public services - as well as its military operations. \"Under Assad, they used to say that Idlib was the forgotten city,\" said Dr Hamza Almoraweh, a cardiologist, as he treated patients in a hospital set up in an old post office warehouse.  He moved from Aleppo with his wife in 2015 when the war there intensified, but was not planning to return, even with the city under rebel control.  \"We've seen a lot of development here. Idlib has a lot of things that it didn't have under the Assad regime.\" As it moderated its tone, seeking to obtain international recognition amid local opposition, HTS revoked some of the strict social rules it had imposed when it came to power, including dress codes for women and a ban on music in schools.  And some people cite recent protests, including against taxes imposed by the government, as proof that a certain level of criticism is tolerated, in contrast with the repression of the Assads. \"It's not a full democracy, but there's freedom,\" said Fuad Sayedissa, an activist.  \"There were some problems at the beginning but, in the last years, they've been acting in a better way and are trying to change.\"  Originally from Idlib, Sayedissa now lives in Turkey, where he runs the non-governmental organisation Violet. Like thousands of Syrians, the fall of Assad meant he could visit his city again – in his case, for the first time in a decade. But demonstrations have also been held against what some say is authoritarian rule. To consolidate power, experts say, the group targeted extremists, absorbed rivals and imprisoned opponents. \"How the government will act in the whole Syria is a different story,\" Sayedissa said. Syria is a diverse country and after decades of oppression and violence perpetrated by the regime and its allies, many are thirsty for justice. \"People are still celebrating, but they're also worried about the future.\" We tried to interview a local official, but were told all of them had gone to Damascus to help in the new government. An hour's drive from Idlib, in the small Christian village of Quniyah, the church bells rang for the first time in a decade on 8 December to celebrate Assad's removal.  The community, near the Turkish border, was bombed during the civil war, which started in 2011 when Assad crushed peaceful protests against him and many of its residents fled.  Only 250 people remained.  \"Syria is better since Assad fell,\" said Friar Fadi Azar. The rise of Islamists, however, has raised fears that minorities, including Assad's Alawites, could be at risk, despite the messages from HTS reassuring religious and ethnic groups that they would be protected.  \"In the last two years, they [HTS] started changing… Before, it was very hard,\" Friar Azar said.  Properties were confiscated and religious rituals restricted.  \"They gave [our community] more freedom, they called on other Christians who were refugees to come back to take their land and homes back.\" But is the change genuine? Can they be trusted? \"What can we do? We have no other option,\" he said. \"We trust them.\" I asked Sayedissa, the activist, why even opponents were reluctant to criticise the group.  \"They're now the heroes… [But] we have red lines. We'll not allow dictators again, Jolani or any other,\" he said, referring to Ahmed al-Shara, the HTS leader who dropped his nom de guerre Abu Mohammad al-Jolani after coming to power. \"If they act as dictators, the people are ready to say no, because they now have their freedom.\"","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8ew16391rdo","published_time":"2024-12-18T06:17:36.714627Z","author_name":"Hugo Bachega","author_designation":"Middle East correspondent","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cc0e/live/74fbf5f0-bca5-11ef-b63a-f359206dd36b.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/22a2/live/f8dfd010-bc8e-11ef-aa02-e39a307484ab.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c092/live/262a4610-bc8d-11ef-aa02-e39a307484ab.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3d40/live/d02ce7f0-bcae-11ef-8e77-9d8d90bbc1c9.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2aeb/live/0435b020-bc8e-11ef-aa02-e39a307484ab.jpg.webp"],"source":"bbc","category":"World","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-18T15:47:36.715Z"}}

Author and podcaster Dent has appeared regularly as a guest on MasterChef, and last year was a contestant on MasterChef: Battle Of The Critics. In a statement, Dent said hosting the show was \"more than a dream to me\" and said she felt \"very lucky\" to be taking the reins.  John Torode, who will remain on the show and host alongside Dent, said he had \"loved\" working with her over the years, describing her as an \"excellent guest and inspiring critic\". Gregg Wallace stepped away from presenting MasterChef following a BBC News investigation which heard allegations of inappropriate sexual comments by 13 people who worked with him. Wallace's lawyers have said it is entirely false that he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature. It has not been confirmed whether Dent will also replace Wallace on the other series in the MasterChef franchise.  Dent, 51, is also the restaurant critic for the Guardian and hosts a podcast called Comfort Eating with Grace Dent, was a contestant on I'm a Celebrity in 2023. But she left the Australian jungle after just a week, on medical grounds. MasterChef (Amateurs) is understood to be currently in production. But the BBC pulled its MasterChef Christmas specials after the allegations against Wallace. Dent said: \"I've been watching MasterChef since I was a girl sitting with my dad on the sofa. My whole family watches it. It's all about uncovering and championing talent - and to have ended up in this position, is more than a dream to me. \"I'm so excited that I can't eat, which is severely detrimental to a restaurant critic. I feel very lucky to be stepping in for the next Celebrity MasterChef. \"I can't wait to meet the fresh celebrity faces for 2025.\" Torode, who has presented MasterChef since 2005, said: \"I have loved working with Grace on MasterChef over the years. She has been an excellent guest, an inspiring critic and also set some incredible challenges. \"Expertise is what MasterChef is all about, from the contestants to our wonderful production team, to us as judges. \"The love of food, the love of MasterChef, and that unquestionable expertise, makes Grace the perfect person to step in alongside me as judge for the forthcoming Celebrity MasterChef series.\" After the allegations were made against Wallace, two MasterChef celebrity Christmas specials, a Celebrity MasterChef Christmas Cook Off and a Strictly Festive Extravaganza, pulled from the BBC's festive schedule.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr56v10v6yro","published_time":"2024-12-18T10:11:41.462857Z","author_name":"Noor Nanji and Steven McIntosh","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/80a0/live/cb0b0730-bb9a-11ef-a0f2-fd81ae5962f4.jpg.webp"],"source":"bbc","category":"World","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-18T15:47:41.463Z"}}

The 22-year-old ended her wait for a global title with victory at Paris 2024. She had previously won successive World Championship silvers after also finishing runner-up on her Olympic debut in Tokyo three years ago. Hodgkinson also retained her European 800m title in Rome and became the sixth-fastest woman of all time when she improved her British record to one minute 54.61 seconds at the London Diamond League. \"I am in a bit of shock,\" Hodgkinson told BBC One. \"I am more excited for my coach as I wouldn't be here without his guidance. \"This year has been incredible and I achieved everything I set out to do on the outdoor track. I hope you loved watching Paris.\" Darts player Luke Littler was second, with England cricketer Joe Root third. Sarah Storey, Alex Yee and Jude Bellingham were also shortlisted for the award by a panel of experts, with the winner decided by a public vote. Hodgkinson is the fourth successive woman to win the award after Mary Earps (2023), Beth Mead (2022) and Emma Raducanu (2021). The Leigh athlete's coaches, Trevor Painter and Jenny Meadows, were recognised with the Coach of the Year award earlier in the night. Recap: Hodgkinson crowned Sports Personality of the Year All the Sports Personality 2024 award winners Littler is Young Sports Personality of the Year Hodgkinson went undefeated over 800m in a sensational year which culminated in the Olympic gold she had been determined to achieve following a series of near-misses. Having retained the European gold which in 2022 represented her first major outdoor title, she triumphed in dominant fashion in Paris to deliver Team GB's first Olympic track title since Mo Farah's 5,000m and 10,000m double at Rio 2016. She became only the 10th British woman to win an athletics gold at an Olympics - and first since Jessica Ennis-Hill at London 2012. A little-known teenager when she announced herself with Olympic silver in Tokyo, Hodgkinson rapidly established herself as one of the world's best as she battled 'Big Three' rivals Athing Mu and Mary Moraa for the sport's biggest prizes. But she has remained unwavering in her determination to take that next step on the podium in her pursuit of becoming one of Britain's most decorated athletes. Now, with the improved British record she set at the London Diamond League in July, athletics' longest-standing world record - Czech athlete Jarmila Kratochvilova ran 1:53.28 in 1983 - could be within Hodgkinson's sights. Next year offers further opportunities for glory with indoor and outdoor World Championships for Hodgkinson to target as a new Olympic cycle begins.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c4gldyp77e0o","published_time":null,"author_name":"","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":[],"source":"bbc","category":"Sports","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-18T15:47:42.886Z"}}
{"_id":{"$oid":"6762a166c3f742fb3373bb5a"},"title_or":"Is this the clearest proof yet Musk wants to get involved in UK politics?","description_or":"The world's disruptor-in-chief, Elon Musk, meets the UK's political disruptor-in- chief, Nigel Farage. And subsequently, Reform UK publishes news-making, cor blimey, take-a-look-at-this photos. But they are more than that, for they are the most clear-cut proof yet of the richest man in the world's desire to get involved in – meddle in, as some see it – British politics. There is another way of describing the pictures of three men at Donald Trump's pad, Mar-a-Lago, in Florida: two billionaires and Farage. Farage had one mega rich man alongside him when meeting someone even richer. Reform UK's new Treasurer is Nick Candy, a billionaire property developer who used to donate to the Conservatives and who, incidentally, is married to the former pop star Holly Valance. But Candy is a pauper compared with Musk, the serial entrepreneurial disruptor in business with his rockets, electric cars and social media platform, now doing the same in politics. Farage is the master of political storytelling freighted with an intrigue that keeps people interested. This time it was all about eye-catching imagery and a teasing but not exactly straight answer about a donation. Money was discussed, we are not told how much, we don't know for certain if it'll ever happen and if it does what it will amount to, but the next chapter was trailed – Trump's inauguration next month, which Farage will be attending. The Reform UK leader, now back from Florida, told me the suggestion Musk might give his party $100m (£78m) was wildly over the top. But a number much smaller than that could still be very big, and game-changing for Reform's prospects. The question is whether it would be legal – and whether it would be seen as legitimate. The All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Elections says it wouldn't and wants the law changed. Downing Street says the government has committed to strengthening the rules, which currently allow donations from UK registered companies. The danger for the government is any change in the law might look like self-interest and changing the rules of the game half way through. But never before have we seen a man as rich, with a megaphone as large, so enthused about strutting the political stage – abroad as well as at home. That poses profound questions about how much influence and from where is judged to be too much influence from too far away. And here is a thought experiment for you: is your own instinct in how you answer those questions driven primarily by what you think of Farage and Musk, or about the principle of foreign donations? The former Conservative minister Miriam Cates wrote on X: \"Now imagine…a picture of Bill Gates with Keir Starmer, pledging support for the Labour Party. You are either for or against foreign interference in British politics. It can't just depend on whether you agree with or like the individual billionaire concerned.\" Farage will be back across the Atlantic in a few weeks to toast Trump's return to the White House. On this latest visit he also managed a photo with the US Vice President Elect, JD Vance. The Reform UK leader has friends in high places and friends with deep pockets. Little wonder he is causing Labour, the Conservatives and others to fret about the political threat they fear he increasingly poses to them.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g3zw1jx7vo","published_time":"2024-12-18T01:17:45.175385Z","author_name":"Chris Mason","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1542/live/0f126d20-bcd0-11ef-9b50-e1ebaae4ab2f.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/40ef/live/12f2e530-bcdc-11ef-a71b-0bf9882eff08.jpg.webp"],"source":"bbc","category":"World","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-18T15:47:45.175Z"}}
{"_id":{"$oid":"6762a166c3f742fb3373bb5b"},"title_or":"Trouble in Arctic town as polar bears and people face warming world","description_or":"\"Can I give you some polar bear advice?\" asks Tee, a confident 13-year-old we meet during a visit to a high school in Churchill, Canada. \"If there's a bear this close to you,\" she says as she measures a distance of about 30cm with her hands, \"make a fist - and punch it in the nose. \"Polar bears have very sensitive noses - it'll just run away.\" Tee has not had to put this advice to the test. But growing up here - alongside the planet's largest land predator - means bear safety is part of everyday life. Signs - in shops and cafes  - remind anyone heading outside to be \"bear aware\". My favourite reads: \"If a polar bear attacks you must fight back.\" Running away from a charging polar bear is – perhaps counterintuitively - dangerous. A bear's instinct is to chase prey and polar bears can run at 25mph (40kmph). Key advice: Be vigilant and aware of your surroundings. Don't walk alone at night. Churchill is known as the polar bear capital of the world. Every year, the Hudson Bay - on the western edge of which the town is perched - thaws, and forces the bears on shore. As the freeze sets in in Autumn, hundreds of bears gather here, waiting.  \"We have freshwater rivers flowing into the area and cold water coming in from the Arctic,\" explains Alyssa McCall from Polar Bears International (PBI). \"So freeze-up happens here first. \"For polar bears, sea ice is a big dinner plate - it's access to their main prey, seals. They're probably excited for a big meal of seal blubber - they haven't been eating much all summer on land.\" There are 20 known sub-populations of polar bears across the Arctic. This is one of the most southerly and best studied. \"They're our fat, white, hairy canaries in the coal mine,\" Alyssa explains. \"We had about 1,200 polar bears here in the 1980s and we've lost almost half of them.\" The decline is tied to the amount of time the bay is now ice-free, a period that is getting longer as the climate warms. No sea ice means no frozen seal-hunting platform. \"Bears here are now on land about a month longer than their grandparents were,\" explains Alyssa. \"That puts pressure on mothers. [With less food] it's harder to stay pregnant and to sustain those babies.\" While their long-term survival is precarious, the bears draw conservation scientists and thousands of tourists to Churchill every year. We tag along with a group from PBI to search for bears on the sub-Arctic tundra - just a few miles from town. The team travels in a tundra buggy, a type of off-road bus with huge tyres. After a few distant sightings, we have a heart-stopping close encounter. A young  bear approaches and investigates our slow two-buggy convoy. He sidles up, sniffs one of the vehicles, then jumps up and plants two giant paws up on the side of the buggy. The bear casually slumps back down onto all fours, then looks up and gazes at me briefly. It is deeply confusing to look into the face of an animal that is simultaneously adorable and potentially deadly. \"You could see him sniffing and even licking the vehicle - using all his senses to investigate,\" says PBI's Geoff York, who has worked in the Arctic for more than three decades. Being here in 'bear season' means Geoff and his colleagues can test new technologies to detect bears and protect people. The PBI team is currently fine-tuning a radar-based system dubbed 'bear-dar'.  The experimental rig - a tall antenna with detectors scanning 360 degrees - is installed on the roof of a lodge in the middle of the tundra, near Churchill. \"It has artificial intelligence, so here we can basically teach it what a polar bear is,\" Geoff explains. \"This works 24/7, it can see at night and in poor visibility.\" Polar bear attacks are rare, but they are a risk for people who live and work in isolated Arctic environments. Earlier this year, a Canadian worker was killed by two polar bears near a remote defence station in Canada's northern Nunavut territory.  Co-existing with these ice-dependent predators, when the Arctic climate is changing faster than at any time in history, creates a paradoxical challenge for Churchill: The polar bear population here faces long-term decline. But, in the short term, the bears are spending more of their year on shore, increasing the probability of bears and people coming into contact. Protecting the community is the task of the polar bear alert team - trained rangers who patrol Churchill every day. We ride along with ranger Ian Van Nest, who is looking for a stubborn bear that he and his colleagues tried to chase away earlier that day. \"It turned around and came back [towards] Churchill. He doesn't seem interested in going away.\" For bears that are intent on hanging around town, the team can use a live trap: A  tube-shaped container, baited with seal meat, with a door that the bear triggers when it climbs inside. \"Then we put them in the holding facility,\" Ian explains. Bears are held for 30 days, a period set to teach a bear that it is a negative thing to come to town looking for food, but that doesn't put the animal's health at risk. They are then moved - either on the back of a trailer or occasionally air-lifted by helicopter – and released further along the bay, away from people. Cyril Fredlund, who works at Churchill's new scientific observatory, remembers the last time a person was killed by a polar bear in Churchill, in 1983. \"It was right in town,\" he says. \"The man was homeless and was in an abandoned building at night. There was a young bear in there too - it took him down with its paw, like he was a seal.\" People came to help, Cyril recalls, but they couldn't get the bear away from the man. \"It was like it was guarding its meal.\" The polar bear alert program was set up around that time. No-one has been killed by a polar bear here since. Cyril is now a technician at the new Churchill Marine Observatory (CMO). Part of its remit is to understand exactly how this environment will respond to climate change. Under its retractable roof are two giant pools filled with water pumped in directly from the Hudson Bay. \"We can do all kinds of controlled experimental studies looking into changes in the Arctic,\" says Prof Feiyue Wang. One implication of a less icy Hudson Bay is a longer operating season for the port, which is currently closed for nine months of the year. A longer season during which the bay thaws and becomes open water could mean more ships coming in and out of Churchill. Studies at the observatory are setting out to improve the accuracy of the sea ice forecast. Research will also examine the risks associated with expanding the port. One of the first investigations is an experimental oil spill. Scientists plan to release oil into one of the pools, test clean-up techniques and measure how quickly the oil degrades in the cold water. For Churchill's mayor, Mike Spence, understanding how to plan for the future, particularly when it comes to shipping goods in and out of Churchill, is vital for the town's future in a warming world. \"We're already looking into extending the season,\" he says, gesturing towards the port, which has ceased operating for the winter. \"In ten years' time, this will be bustling.\" Climate change poses a challenge for the polar bear capital of the world, but the mayor is optimistic. \"We have a great town,\" he says, \"a wonderful community. And the summer season - [when people come to see the Beluga whales in the bay] - is growing.\" \"We're all being challenged by climate change,\" he adds. \"Does that mean you stop existing? No - you adapt. You work out how to take advantage of it.\" While Mike Spence says \"the future is bright\" for Churchill, it might not be so bright for the polar bears. Tee and her friends look out over the bay, from a window at the back of the school building. The polar bear alert team's vehicles are gathering outside, trying to move a bear away from town. \"If climate change continues,\" muses Tee's classmate Charlie, \"the polar bears might just stop coming here.\" The teacher approaches to make sure the children have someone coming to pick them up - that they're not walking home alone. All part of the daily routine in the polar bear capital of the world.

{"_id":{"$oid":"6762a166c3f742fb3373bb5c"},"title_or":"General's assassination pierces Moscow's air of normality","description_or":"Appearance and reality: there is a constant battle in Moscow between the two. Despite nearly three years of war, life here can seem so normal: from the crowds of commuters on the Metro to the bars and clubs packed with young Muscovites. Then, suddenly, something happens to remind you: there is nothing normal about Russia today. That \"something\" can be a Ukrainian drone penetrating Moscow's air defences. Or - even more dramatic - what happened on Tuesday morning: the targeted assassination of a senior Russian general as he walked out of an apartment block. When Lt Gen Igor Kirillov and his assistant Ilya Polikarpov were killed by a bomb concealed on an electric scooter, the reality of Russia's war on Ukraine hit home. At least to those Russians close to the crime scene. \"It's one thing reading about it in the news, it feels far, but when it happens next door to you, that's completely different and frightening,\" Liza tells me. She lives one building from the site of the blast. \"Until now, [the war] felt as if it was happening a long way off - now someone is dead, here, you can feel the consequences. \"My anxiety has gone through the roof. Every sound you hear unnerves you - you wonder whether it's a drone or something at a construction site,\" Liza says. This perception of Russia's war in Ukraine as something distant - I've heard that so often here. I get the sense that, for a considerable portion of the population, this is a war they only experience on their TV screen or on their smart phone. In many ways, a virtual war. Astonishing, really, considering the large number of dead and wounded. But the killing of a Russian general in Moscow: that is a definite wake-up call; proof that this war is very real and very close to home. Will it serve as a wake-up call for the Russian authorities? Probably not. There is little sign of a Kremlin U-turn on Ukraine. Moscow is far more likely to intensify the war. Just look at the signs. Reacting to news of Kirillov's killing, the host of a political talk show on Russian state TV blamed Ukraine and claimed that \"with this attack President Zelensky has signed his own death sentence\". Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said \"investigators must find the killers in Russia.\" He added: \"We must do everything to destroy their patrons who are in Kyiv.\" From President Vladimir Putin there has been no public reaction so far to the killing of the general and his assistant.  But the Kremlin leader has said many times before that, faced with security threats, Russia \"will always respond\". Based on that pledge, retaliation is likely. On Thursday, the Kremlin leader is due to hold his annual end-of-year press conference and phone-in. It's normally a marathon affair broadcast live by all the main TV channels. I wonder: will he use the event to comment on the dramatic early morning assassination of Kirillov? Will he break his silence on Syria? The Russian president has so far said nothing publicly about the fall of Bashar al-Assad, Moscow's key ally in the Middle East. And what will he tell Russians about where their country is heading, as the war in Ukraine - what Putin still calls his \"special military operation\" - approaches the three-year mark?","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czjdmgnj242o","published_time":"2024-12-17T23:17:50.300349Z","author_name":"Steve Rosenberg","author_designation":"BBC Russia editor","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/574c/live/e66e15b0-bcc8-11ef-939e-1bec212f355e.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5b89/live/47996ba0-bcc9-11ef-939e-1bec212f355e.jpg.webp"],"source":"bbc","category":"World","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-18T15:47:50.3Z"}}
{"_id":{"$oid":"6762a166c3f742fb3373bb5d"},"title_or":"Could this be what our home on Moon or Mars might look like?","description_or":"Could this egg-shaped structure be what the future home of Indian astronauts in space looks like? The Hab-1 - short for Habitat-1 – is Indian space agency Isro's first-ever \"analog mission\" which means simulation of space conditions to prepare astronauts for real space missions. It was recently tested for three weeks in the high Himalayan mountains of Ladakh. Space architect Aastha Kacha-Jhala, from Gujarat-based firm Aaka, told the BBC that these simulations help identify and address issues astronauts and equipment might face before space missions. Built with space-grade Teflon and insulated with industrial-use foam, Hab-1 has a bed, a stowaway tray which can be pulled out and used as a workstation, storage space to keep supplies and emergency kits, a kitchenette for heating meals and a toilet. An astronaut in simulation spent three weeks holed up in the facility. \"Hab-1 is designed keeping in mind that space is going to be very limited on the Moon or Mars,\" Ms Kacha-Jhala says. \"The astronaut will also have very limited water so we designed a dry toilet. We also put in place a system for a proper disposal of waste and ensured that the habitat remained odour-free.\" She is now in talks with Isro to build India's first permanent simulation space facility in Ladakh. The mission comes at a time when India is preparing to send its first astronauts into space.  Isro's Gaganyaan mission plans to place three astronauts into low-Earth orbit at an altitude of 400km (248 miles) for three days. If all goes according to plan, the mission will launch sometime next year. India also plans to set up its first space station by 2035 and send a man to the Moon by 2040. Nasa, European Space Agency, Russia, China and other countries and private firms with space programmes run dozens of simulation missions and two of the four Indian astronauts selected for the Gaganyaan mission are being trained at Nasa at the moment. \"Once we have our own simulation mission, we won't have to depend on foreign space agencies to train our astronauts,\" says Prof Subrat Sharma, Dean of Research Studies at Ladakh University which collaborated on the project. Ladakh, he told the BBC, was chosen for the experiment because \"from a geographical perspective, its rocky, barren landscape and soil have similarities with the material and rocks found on Mars and some parts of the lunar terrain which make it ideal for space research\". The soil samples collected during the mission are being tested by the university to see if astronauts will be able to use locally-sourced materials to build homes in space. The Himalayan region on the India-China border is located at a height of 3,500 metres (11,483ft) and has extreme climatic conditions and thin air. In a day, the temperature here can shift from a maximum of 20C to a minimum of -18C.  It's no match for Mars (where temperatures can go below -153C) or Moon (where -250C is the norm in some deep craters), but still, it's a test of human endurance. And as Prof Sharma says, \"since you can't go to space to test every time, you need these facilities where space-like conditions can be created\". Also, he adds, Ladakh is one region of India where barren land stretches for miles and miles, \"giving you the feeling of being alone on the planet\". And that's exactly how the simulation astronaut, who spent three weeks confined in the capsule in the icy cold desert, felt. \"I was isolated from the human environment. Every move that I made was scheduled, when to wake up, what to do when and when to sleep? A 24x7 camera monitored every move and sent data about my activities and health to the back office,\" the 24-year-old who did not want to be named told me. \"The initial few days,\" he said, \"were great, but then it began to feel repetitive and it started to get to me. It started impacting my daily performance. My sleep schedule was affected a little and my concentration deteriorated.\" The simulation astronaut wore biometric devices to monitor his sleep pattern, heart rate and stress levels. His blood and saliva were tested daily to see how he was coping. Scientists say simulating psychological factors to see how they would impact humans in space is one of the most important parts of the mission. With space agencies from across the world aiming to send astronauts to the Moon and set up permanent bases there in the coming years, simulation missions are expected to play a crucial role in research and training. In April, a team of scientists and engineers began trials in Oregon to prepare Nasa's robot dog – Lassie – to walk on the Moon's surface. In July, four volunteers emerged after spending a year at an \"analog\" facility, specially built in Texas to simulate life on Mars.  And according to the Economist magazine, Nasa hopes to 3D-print a base using only materials found on the Moon's surface, while China and Russia are collaborating on their own plans.⁠ India doesn't want to be left behind. Prof Sharma says once the data gathered in Ladakh is analysed, it \"will help us develop medical technology to deal with the needs of our astronauts when they face a problem in space\". \"We need to know how our bodies will function on the Moon where days and nights are a lot longer than on Earth. Or in space where there's not enough oxygen\" he says.

{"_id":{"$oid":"6762a166c3f742fb3373bb5e"},"title_or":"'My ex had such a small sentence for strangling me'","description_or":"WARNING: This article contains description of crimes which some readers may find upsetting \"It shouldn't be disregarded as a small crime, I thought I'd die when it happened to me.\" The words of Sophie Henson, 24, who said she felt reassured to see \"strangulation taken seriously\" now by the justice system. She was strangled by her ex-partner when she was 36 weeks pregnant and in a remote location away from her house. She and other survivors of strangulation have welcomed new guidance on punishing offenders after the Sentencing Council - which promotes transparency and consistency - issued the first recommendations for judges and magistrates in Wales and England. Sophie from Bridgend, said: \"I felt like a dead fish, my mouth was open, my body was so limp.\" Her ex-partner Zac Pennell was convicted of both coercive control and intentional strangulation in January, with a sentence of 21 months. \"It was heartbreaking. I felt it was such a low sentence for how dangerous it is.\" \"I think the new guidance will help people seek justice, that it'll be taken seriously and it's a positive step,\" she added. She described strangulation as an \"up close and personal attack\" which can and does take lives. It comes after an earlier announcement that jealous ex-partners who kill or strangle their victims will receive tougher jail terms. Rachel Williams, a domestic abuse survivor and campaigner who was instrumental in introducing the offences into law, was shot by her ex-husband in 2011 and left with life-changing injuries. The offences were created by the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 and came into force on 7 June 2022.  However, these offences are not limited to domestic abuse situations.  Non-fatal strangulation is not a specific offence in Scotland, though it is under consideration. \"Six weeks before the shooting, I was strangled so furiously that's what made me decide to leave the relationship,\" said Rachel. \"It woke my kids up from the bedroom upstairs and one of them said they thought they could hear a pig squealing because of the noise I was making,\" she added. She said the guidelines were long overdue for victims and survivors. \"The criminal justice system at the moment is on the floor because we're constantly seeing perpetrators not held accountable for their actions.\" \"Hopefully this will mean custodial sentences, and send out the message that this is severe, and you will be severely punished,\" she added. She said the change could encourage more victims to report attacks to police and other services. \"Time will tell: we're fed up of lip service - there needs to be action. If we see more perpetrators of non-fatal strangulation going to court, then we will have more faith in that.\" Johanna Robinson, a member of the Sentencing Council, called the new guidelines \"a really important recognition of the harm that occurs within strangulation and suffocation\". \"The physical harm signs can be quite limited, but it can lead to strokes, brain injury and fatalities,\" she said. \"I think because of the lack of physical signs it can make people underestimate how often it happens.\" Ms Robinson, who is also the national adviser to the Welsh government on violence against women, domestic abuse and sexual violence, said recognising the harm both physically and psychologically was key for the guidance. \"It also encourages judges to look for signs of planning and intent to cause serious harm, and question if there's a different charge of say attempted murder,\" she said. She said she understood frustrations in the wait behind the introduction of the guidelines. But there were processes such as consultation with the public and experts, along with work in the courts. \"I hope this sends a strong message and in turn a prevention. However, public campaigning and education to help people understand the risks is also key.\" Prof Catherine White, medical director at the Institute For Addressing Strangulation, said: \"We are pleased to have had the opportunity to feed into the guideline development.\"  \"We hope that this will help dispel common misconceptions around this act, such as a tendency to overestimate the likelihood of visible external injury, a lack of understanding as to the extent of potential internal injury resulting from strangulation, and a lack of appreciation as to the inherent harm done by the act of strangulation regardless of evidence of physical injury.\" If you have been affected by any issues raised in this article, help and support can be found at BBC Action Line.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3we4vegy4eo","published_time":"2024-12-18T06:17:52.166088Z","author_name":"Gemma Dunstan","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/880c/live/572f1c10-bc77-11ef-9e94-492e454c4f8c.png.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b109/live/63cd8950-bbd4-11ef-96a6-9d05544d8e20.png.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/261a/live/3ee2b630-bc77-11ef-9e94-492e454c4f8c.png.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dc71/live/3cc02bf0-bbd5-11ef-96a6-9d05544d8e20.png.webp"],"source":"bbc","category":"World","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-18T15:47:52.166Z"}}
{"_id":{"$oid":"6762a166c3f742fb3373bb5f"},"title_or":"Why are prices rising in the UK?","description_or":"Prices in the UK went up by 2.6% in the 12 months to November, the highest level for eight months. It means inflation has been above the Bank of England's target for two months in a row. The Bank moves interest rates up and down to try to keep inflation at 2%, and has cut twice in 2024, taking rates to 4.75%.  Inflation is the increase in the price of something over time. For example, if a bottle of milk costs £1 but is £1.05 a year later, then annual milk inflation is 5%.  The prices of hundreds of everyday items, including food and fuel, are tracked by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This virtual \"basket of goods\" is regularly updated to reflect shopping trends, with vinyl records and air fryers added in 2024, and hand sanitiser removed. The ONS monitors price changes over the previous 12 months to calculate inflation. The main inflation measure is called the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), external, and the latest figure is published every month. CPI rose by 2.6% in the year to November 2024, up from 2.3% in the 12 months to October. The November figure is the highest rate since March 2024. This was largely as a result of increased fuel and clothing prices. Inflation has fallen significantly since it hit 11.1% in October 2022, which was the highest rate for 40 years. However, that doesn't mean prices are falling - just that they are rising less quickly. Inflation soared in 2022 because oil and gas were in greater demand after the Covid pandemic, and energy prices surged again when Russia invaded Ukraine.  It then remained well above the 2% target partly because of high food prices. Some parts of the economy, like the services sector - which includes everything from restaurants to hairdressers - are still seeing significant price rises. When inflation was well above its 2% target, the Bank of England increased interest rates to 5.25%, a 16-year high.  The idea is that if you make borrowing more expensive, people have less money to spend. People may also be encouraged to save more. In turn, this reduces demand for goods and slows price rises. But it is a balancing act - increasing borrowing costs risks harming the economy. For example, homeowners face higher mortgage repayments, which can outweigh better savings deals.  Businesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs. Some may cut staff and reduce investment.  In November 2024, the Bank of England cut rates to 4.75%, in a move that had been widely expected. That followed a drop from 5.25% to 5% in August, which was the first fall for four years.  The Bank also considers other measures, external, such as \"core inflation\" when deciding whether and how to change rates.  Core inflation doesn't include food or energy prices because they tend to be very volatile, so can be a better indication of longer term trends. The measure was 3.5% in November, up from 3.3% in the year to October. In October, the Bank governor Andrew Bailey said it could be a \"bit more aggressive\" at cutting borrowing costs, if inflation remained under control. However, after the Budget at the end of that month, the Bank predicted that the policies it contained - such as an increase in National Insurance Contributions paid by employers -  would lift inflation slightly as businesses would pass on their increased costs through higher prices. Announcing the November rate decision, Mr Bailey indicated any further cuts were likely to be gradual, adding: \"We need to make sure inflation stays close to target, so we can't cut interest rates too quickly or by too much.\"  In December the OECD think tank also predicted that rates would be higher for longer due to UK Budget measures. The Bank is widely expected to hold rates at 4.75% at its next meeting on Thursday 19 December. Will UK interest rate cut make my mortgage cheaper? How the Budget will affect you and your money The latest official quarterly figures, external show that regular pay grew more quickly than expected between August and October. Average annual growth in pay (excluding bonuses) during the three-month period was 5.2%, up from 4.8% between July and September.  This was the first increase for more than a year, and means wages are growing significantly more quickly than inflation.

The inflation rate for countries using the euro was 2% in October, up from 1.7% in September.  In June, the European Central Bank (ECB) cut its main interest rate from an all-time high of 4% to 3.75%, the first fall in five years.  It has since cut rates three times: to 3.5% in September, to 3.25% in October and to 3% in December, external. US inflation was 2.7% in November, up from to 2.6% in October, as a result of higher petrol and food costs. At its September meeting, the US central bank lowered rates for the first time in four years, cutting its key lending rate by 0.5 percentage points to between 4.75% and 5%. The cut was larger than many analysts had predicted.  In November, the Federal Reserve announced a further cut, taking the key rate to between 4.5% and 4.75%. Analysts expect a further cut at the bank's December meeting.

{"_id":{"$oid":"6762a166c3f742fb3373bb61"},"title_or":"Minister found Ask for Angela response unsatisfactory when undercover","description_or":"A government minister has revealed she covertly tested the Ask for Angela safety scheme at venues across the UK until she became too well-known to continue the undercover checks. The scheme, launched in 2016 and named after Angela Crompton who was killed by her husband, allows people to discreetly signal they need help by using a code word at participating venues. Jess Phillips, minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, disclosed her secret visits after a BBC investigation found more than half of participating venues failed to implement the scheme properly. Phillips says she found the response in the pubs and bars she checked herself wholly unsatisfactory. \"I have tested the Ask for Angela system a number of times, not just in London, but around the country and where I see it,\" Phillips told the BBC. \"And I have to say, I have always found the response wanting.\" Phillips added that she \"likes to test\" safety systems like Ask for Angela, but has become too well known now to continue. Her comments came after BBC undercover researchers posed as a couple on a date, with a female researcher approaching bar staff appearing distressed and asking for Angela. The investigation found widespread confusion among staff. At more than half of the 25 London venues tested, staff were completely unaware of what the emergency codeword meant despite their venues displaying Ask for Angela posters.  The BBC received similar reports from around the UK. Phillips praised the BBC's investigation, saying she felt \"really grateful to the good work done by BBC London in highlighting that\". The minister, who previously worked developing services for victims of domestic abuse at Women's Aid in the West Midlands, emphasised that safety schemes were \"meaningless if you don't implement things properly on the ground\". She said: \"None of these schemes are ever fit for purpose if they are not trained properly. \"New laws, things written down on fancy scrolls that sit in the basement of the House of Commons.\"  Her comments come after the government announced new training initiatives around spiking.  Phillips stressed the importance of maintaining ongoing training rather than \"pink washing\" venues by simply displaying posters. Following the BBC investigation, Cambridgeshire, West Midlands and Hertfordshire police forces announced they had conducted spot checks. The BBC findings mirror similar failures in the scheme's implementation reported by women's safety groups across other parts of the UK. Staff at large chains including Greene King and JD Wetherspoon were among those who did not recognise the code word.  Greene King said it was concerned by the BBC's findings and pledged to review how the scheme was communicated to its teams, while JD Wetherspoon said it would provide additional training if necessary. Westminster City Council currently makes participation in the Ask for Angela scheme a key factor when deciding to grant alcohol licences.  Hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money has been spent promoting the initiative by police and local councils. The safety scheme has since spread to other countries including Canada and the Netherlands.

The Pope writes that, after landing in Baghdad in March 2021, he was told an event at which he was set to appear was being targeted by two suicide bombers. Both attackers were subsequently intercepted and killed, he said in excerpts published by Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. The visit, which took place over three days during the coronavirus pandemic, was the first ever to Iraq by a pope and saw an intense security operation.  The years before had seen increased sectarian violence in Iraq, with fighting between Shia and Sunni Muslims as well as the persecution of religious minorities.  The country's Christian community had shrunk dramatically, having been targeted in particular by the Islamic State group and other Sunni extremists. In excerpts of his autobiography, the Pope says \"almost everyone advised me against\" the visit but he felt he \"had to do it\". He says the plot was uncovered by British intelligence, who warned Iraqi police, and they in turn told his security detail once he had touched down.  \"A woman packed with explosives, a young suicide bomber, was heading towards Mosul to blow herself up during the papal visit,\" he says.  \"And a van had also set off at great speed with the same intention.\"  The Pope adds that he asked a security official the following day what had happened to the would-be attackers.  \"The [official] replied laconically: 'They are no more'. The Iraqi police had intercepted them and blown them up,\" he wrote. The book, entitled Hope, is due to be published on 14 January.  The Vatican did not immediately respond to a request for comment, according to Reuters news agency.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0lg628z1z0o","published_time":"2024-12-18T05:17:57.176474Z","author_name":"Christy Cooney","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/53be/live/6f951fd0-bcf8-11ef-8937-3dc31bce822c.jpg.webp"],"source":"bbc","category":"Entertainment","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-18T15:47:57.176Z"}}

Jamie Gray, 31, who lives in Halstead, Essex, was with his father Kevin Gray, from Stowmarket, Suffolk, watching West Ham play in Stratford, east London, on 9 December. His 61-year-old father collapsed and died at the stadium, and his Rolex Submariner watch went missing. \"He had that watch for 20 years after being given it as a birthday present and he wore it every day. We don't care about the money it's worth, but we just want it back because it was so important to him,\" Jamie Gray said. The finance manager posted an appeal on X saying his family was desperate to get back the \"sentimental\" watch, which was thought to be worth about £14,000. \"Dad was one of the nicest blokes going, he would do anything for anyone. He'd been taking me to watch West Ham play since I was five years old,\" he said. \"People have offered to raise money to buy a new one but we don't want a new watch, we just want our Dad's watch.  \"We would never sell it, we just want to keep it in the family and pass it down to our children. It's a reminder of him and it would mean everything to get it back,\" he said. His father, who had three grandchildren and was a taxi driver in Sudbury, Suffolk, showed no signs of being ill before he suddenly collapsed, five minutes before the game ended. Stewards and medics from St John Ambulance carried him up some stairs to a flat surface to begin CPR, and the watch disappeared. \"I'd like to think it's an innocent accident, that maybe it fell off. We won't hold any grudges or hold anyone accountable, we just want it to be returned,\" he said. The family reported the incident to the Metropolitan Police, who said in a statement that officers were \"carrying out all relevant inquiries in order to locate the watch\" but there had been no arrests \"at this early stage\". A spokesperson from London Stadium said: \"We would like to send our condolences to the family. We are assisting the football club by investigating the CCTV footage from Monday evening.\"  Follow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2v1mk30vro","published_time":"2024-12-18T06:17:58.699834Z","author_name":"Charlie Jones","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ad1a/live/cc99e180-bc7f-11ef-9e94-492e454c4f8c.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5fd5/live/98a870e0-bcab-11ef-a0f2-fd81ae5962f4.jpg.webp"],"source":"bbc","category":"Business","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-18T15:47:58.7Z"}}

Piana, 32, had been exploring an uncharted area of the Abisso Bueno Fonteno cave on Saturday afternoon when a rock gave way beneath her feet and she fell 5-6m (16-19ft), sustaining injuries to her vertebrae, ribs, face and knee. More than 150 volunteers, led by Italy's Alpine and cave rescue corps, took part in the operation, and her stretcher was brought out at about 03:00 (02:00 GMT) on Wednesday. Piana is an experienced speleologist, and this was the second time in 17 months that she was rescued from the cave system. \"She's tired, exhausted and in pain...We have succeeded,\" said Giorgio Pannuzzo, a rescue volunteer who was with her at the time of the accident on Saturday.  \"There was a freezing wind right by the entrance [to the cave] and if we'd stopped she would have suffered even more from the cold. So we were in a rush,\" he told Italian media. Piana was taking part in a project to map a previously unknown area of the Abisso Bueno Fonteno cave system when she fell. The area between Lake Iseo and Lake Endine comprises a network of caves, tunnels and underground galleries, the majority of which have never been explored. Rescuers spoke of a race against time to get her out because of her injuries. Dozens of volunteers took turns to carry her stretcher and clear the many obstructions that got in their way. They had to navigate narrow tunnels and at times use small explosive charges to get her out. The CNSAS Alpine rescue service said 159 volunteers from 13 Italian regions took part in the operation. \"The injured woman was constantly monitored and assisted by a total of six doctors and eight nurses,\" it said. \"The rescue operation went on uninterrupted for 75 hours.\" During the operation, Piana told her doctors that she never wanted to set foot in the cave again.","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c878en33yd8o","published_time":"2024-12-18T09:18:01.021929Z","author_name":"Paul Kirby","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":[],"source":"bbc","category":"Entertainment","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-18T15:48:01.022Z"}}
{"_id":{"$oid":"6762a166c3f742fb3373bb65"},"title_or":"Watchdog says police unprepared for scale of riots","description_or":"Police were unprepared for the scale of disorder that broke out in part of the UK following the Southport knife attacks, a police watchdog has found. Police intelligence did not predict the \"rising tide of violent disorder well enough\", according to the review of their response to the worst UK unrest in more than a decade. Chief Inspector of Constabulary Andy Cooke praised officers for their \"immense bravery and personal sacrifice\" while protecting the public. But he warned it was \"clear\" that police had missed opportunities to prepare for widespread disorder, and that earlier incidents involving \"extreme nationalist sentiment\" had been underestimated. After Bebe King, Elsie Dot Stancombe and Alice Da Silva Aguiar were fatally stabbed in Southport July 2024, a riot in the town was quickly followed by violent disorder across the country. More than 600 arrests were made as police responded to what Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer described as \"far-right thuggery,\" with crowds targeting mosques and accommodation housing asylum seekers. The review by His Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services warned police intelligence should have \"more fully\" considered a series of earlier incidents that were indicators of future unrest. These included disorder near hotels housing asylum seekers in Merseyside and Llanelli in 2023, as well as violence during Armistice Day in London. \"Our assessment of these incidents suggests that the risks of disorder were greater than the police believed them to be,\" the review said. It also found some forces had not fully acted on previous recommendations made following incidents of disorder, including the 2011 London riots. \"We shouldn't have to repeat our recommendations,\" the report noted. It said a system to move officers between forces to bolster resources was brought in \"too late\" during the riots, and there were also concerns some officers had been sent out in regular uniform rather than riot gear. Police officers, it added, had been targeted deliberately by rioters, with many injured and some taken to hospital. \"The professionalism of those leading the response deserves credit,\" Chief Inspector Cooke said. \"But the systems and processes they work under need to change.\" The review recommended impovements in forces' ability to respond to widespread violent disorder, their mobilisation of public order and public safety resources, and their support for officers and staff.  \"There is every possibility that similar violence and disorder could reoccur across the UK. The police service needs to be ready to respond,\" said Chief Inspector Cooke . The watchdog will publish a further report in 2025 focused on how social media affected the riots.

In the message, 27-year-old said the firm was working to improve its work culture, which included hiring managers with more experience and introducing monthly anonymous surveys of staff.  Ms Djerf, who started her online influencer career in 2016, said she was committed to \"getting it right\". \"When I started Djerf Avenue I never expected that the company would be what it is today, with so many team members and so much responsibility,\" she wrote.   \"I'll keep learning and working to ensure Djerf Avenue is a safe, inclusive space for everyone.\" Launched in 2019, Djerf Avenue rapidly gained a following among young women for wardrobe staples such as oversize button-down shirts and trousers.  The brand, which reported around $35m (£27.5m) in revenue last year, is known for its size inclusivity and diverse model representation. But it has been facing outcry from customers after Aftonbladet reported claims bullying and body-shaming. It said that some models were told they did not fill out a pair of jeans, while others were called fat. Djerf Avenue recently held its first 10-day pop-up shop in London, which saw queues forming up to three hours before the store opened. Journalism student Evie Summers, who attended the pop-up to write a report, said the allegations against Ms Djerf were \"incredibly disappointing and discouraging to the young, impressionable people who adore her\". She said the apology was the only route available to Ms Djerf, who has won a following not just for her designs, but for her \"lifestyle and values\".  \"With this in mind, it's especially important for her to reflect the brand values of kindness and inclusivity towards her staff,\" the 19-year-old said. In her message, Ms Djerf said she hoped to rebuild trust with her fans. \"I had never built a company prior to this, and under a lot of stress, high tempo and naivety I failed to be the leader and colleague I wish to be along the way,\" she added. London resident Samantha Rogers said the controversy was a reminder that brands had to live by their values. \"I'm definitely sad about what's happened, but I also think it's great that brands are being called out when they don't stick to the values they promote,\" the 32-year-old told the BBC.  \"If your brand doesn't feel real, it won't stand the test of time.\"","url":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy4e1e274xo","published_time":"2024-12-17T21:18:03.876786Z","author_name":"Natalie Sherman","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/88c5/live/bea1f2a0-bcbd-11ef-a0f2-fd81ae5962f4.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0886/live/828f8cd0-bcab-11ef-9a72-35c2cb6699c1.jpg.webp","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/edb1/live/34f95640-bcab-11ef-9a72-35c2cb6699c1.jpg.webp"],"source":"bbc","category":"Sports","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-18T15:48:03.877Z"}}

The England international, 27, said on Tuesday that he was \"ready for a new challenge and the next steps\" in his career.  It came two days after Rashford was dropped for United's derby win against Manchester City at Etihad Stadium. Rashford's last Premier League start came in a 4-0 win against Everton on 1 December, when he scored twice.  Amorim suggested the club want the striker - who came through United's youth ranks - to stay, saying: \"I don't talk about the future, we talk about the present.  \"This kind of club needs big talent and he's a big talent, so he just needs to perform at the highest level and that is my focus. I just want to help Marcus.\" Asked about Rashford's desire for a \"new challenge\", Amorim said: \"I think it's right. We have here a new challenge, it's a tough one. \"For me it's the biggest challenge in football because we are in a difficult situation and I already said this is one of the biggest clubs in the world.  \"I really hope all my players are ready for this new challenge.\" Amorim added the club will \"try different things\" to help Rashford find the \"best levels he has shown in the past\". United face Tottenham in the quarter-finals of the EFL Cup on Thursday. Amorim refused to confirm whether Rashford or winger Alejandro Garnacho - who was also left out of the squad to face City - would feature against Spurs. \"We have one more training session, but it's the same situation [for] all the other players,\" said Amorim. \"If they train well then I have to make a choice.

The 16-year-old Lancashire batter is the son of the Lions coach and legendary former England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff. A youthful 16-man party also includes England Test players Shoaib Bashir, Tom Hartley and Josh Tongue. Part of England's wider preparations for the Ashes next winter, the Lions play two matches against a Cricket Australia XI and a four-day unofficial Test against Australia A. Rocky Flintoff signed his first professional deal for Lancashire in June off the back of making a century for the club's second XI in April. He made his first-team debut in July and has since played four first-class matches and seven List A games. Andrew Flintoff, 47, was named Lions head coach in September. On his first tour in charge, in South Africa earlier this month, Rocky was promoted from the England Under-19s to the Lions. Off-spinner Bashir has played 15 Tests since making his England debut on the tour of India in February. His inclusion is an opportunity for experience in Australia before his expected role as England's first-choice spinner during the Ashes. Left-arm spinner Hartley played all five Tests in India in early 2024 but has not been part of an England squad since the T20 World Cup. Pace bowler Tongue played in the home Ashes of 2023 and is working back to fitness from a pectoral injury that has kept him out of action for more than a year. Pace bowlers John Turner and Pat Brown, who have both played for the senior England team in white-ball cricket, are also included. Warwickshire captain Alex Davies, 30, and prolific Essex seamer Sam Cook, 27, provide experience. Promising Somerset wicketkeeper-batter James Rew has been a fixture in recent Lions squads. Along with Flintoff, there are a number of players with fewer than 10 first-class matches, including pace bowler John Turner and batters Ben McKinney, Freddie McCann and Hamza Shaikh. Pace bowlers Sonny Baker and Mitchell Stanley, of Hampshire and Lancashire respectively, are yet to make their first-class debuts. Left-arm seamer Josh Hull, who made his Test debut against Sri Lanka in September, will travel as part of his return from a quad injury, but is not part of the official squad. England Lions squad for tour of Australia: Sonny Baker (Hampshire), Shoaib Bashir (Somerset), Pat Brown (Derbyshire), James Coles (Sussex), Sam Cook (Essex), Alex Davies (Warwickshire), Rocky Flintoff (Lancashire), Tom Hartley (Lancashire), Tom Lawes (Surrey), Freddie McCann (Nottinghamshire).

The England international, 27, said on Tuesday that he was \"ready for a new challenge and the next steps\" in his career.  It came two days after Rashford was dropped for United's derby win against Manchester City at Etihad Stadium. Rashford's last Premier League start came in a 4-0 win against Everton on 1 December, when he scored twice.  Amorim suggested the club want the striker - who came through United's youth ranks - to stay, saying: \"I don't talk about the future, we talk about the present.  \"This kind of club needs big talent and he's a big talent, so he just needs to perform at the highest level and that is my focus. I just want to help Marcus.\" Asked about Rashford's desire for a \"new challenge\", Amorim said: \"I think it's right. We have here a new challenge, it's a tough one. \"For me it's the biggest challenge in football because we are in a difficult situation and I already said this is one of the biggest clubs in the world.  \"I really hope all my players are ready for this new challenge.\" Amorim added the club will \"try different things\" to help Rashford find the \"best levels he has shown in the past\". United face Tottenham in the quarter-finals of the EFL Cup on Thursday. Amorim refused to confirm whether Rashford or winger Alejandro Garnacho - who was also left out of the squad to face City - would feature against Spurs. \"We have one more training session, but it's the same situation [for] all the other players,\" said Amorim. \"If they train well then I have to make a choice.

Victory would have cemented the Gypsy King's status as the greatest of his generation. Instead, it was Usyk who become boxing's first four-belt undisputed heavyweight champion, with Fury left licking his wounds and pondering what could have been. \"It was the most important heavyweight fight of the 21st century, which lived up to all expectations and a result which could have gone either way, but Fury isn't a cry-baby,\" promoter Frank Warren says. Fury – who was saved by the bell in the ninth round - did not make excuses in the immediate aftermath of the split-decision points loss. Usyk v Fury 2 - all you need to know However, an eye injury and consequent lack of sparring, chaos instigated by his team and tragedy back home in Lancashire all contributed to Fury's demise. With insight from those who know Fury best, BBC Sport looks at what adjustments the two-time champion has made in preparing for Saturday's rematch.  Fury missed out on a chance to become undisputed champion. The IBF title - now held by Daniel Dubois - will not be on the line in the rematch Earlier this year, Fury's preparation for the most notable fight of his career was far from ideal. A cut to his right eye picked up in sparring delayed it by three months. Assistant trainer Andy Lee says Fury was unable to engage in head spars from thereon. The 36-year-old is now back in Riyadh for the rematch having held his training camp in Malta, more than 2,000 miles from his home town of Morecambe. The hilltop village of Mellieha provided a hotter climate, less media intrusion and is an hour closer to the Saudi time zone. Heavyweights Moses Itauma and Kevin Lerena, who sparred Fury for both fights, tell BBC Sport this camp has gone smoothly. Lerana has seen a \"massive turnaround\" and Itauma says Fury is \"100% serious about getting revenge\". Former world champion Richie Woodhall feels the lack of sparring before the first fight may have proved the difference. \"Fury was coasting against Usyk but his problem was he ran out of gas and got caught,\" Woodhall says. \"The most important part of your training programme is your sparring and running. If he wasn't sparring, it definitely affected his gas tank, without a shadow of a doubt.\" LISTEN: 5 Live Boxing with Bunce from Riyadh Tears, tantrums & testing times - how boxers deal with a first defeat 'I don't want a life of regret' - how Allen came back from boxing's brink This video can not be played Watch as Usyk asks Fury to sign picture of him being punched in the face Before their first fight, the unpredictable Fury refused to make eye contact with Usyk at one face-off before shoving his opponent a day later, but it was the antics of his father which dominated the headlines. John Fury appeared to headbutt a member of Usyk's entourage early in fight week. He was a part of his son's anarchic corner on fight night, barking instructions as his voice drowned out head trainer SugarHill Steward. Warren expects Team Fury to be on their best behaviour and for John – who will once again work the corner – to take a backseat. \"There were a couple of moments where being a parent became more important to him than being a cornerman, which I totally understand, but this time the corner will operate differently – it has to,\" Warren says. Fury's wife is also expected to watch from ringside. Paris Fury, at six months pregnant, lost their baby on the eve of the first bout and was unable to join her husband in Riyadh. \"I could really feel her absence. You can usually feel her influence in the dressing room,\" Warren says. \"But I'm quite sure Paris will be there for the rematch, and there have also been no cuts this time, so I hope the whole aspect of what is happening outside of the ring changes what happens inside it.\"  Although only Fury and his trusted insiders will truly know how physically and mentally ready he was in May, Itauma has noticed a change in mindset. \"He's definitely more on it,\" he says.  \"I'm not saying he wasn't before but I do feel like he's more on the ball.  \"Tyson may not show it in public but there's been a switch in his mentality which could win him the rematch.\" Usyk v Fury 2 to be broadcast on BBC Radio 5 Live Usyk - who was won all 22 pro fights - is an Olympic gold medallist and a two-weight undisputed champion  Trainer Dave Coldwell, who was in Tony Bellew's corner when he lost to Usyk in 2018, predicts the outcome of the rematch will be determined by tactics in the ring and not by any goading or trash talk. Coldwell also feels southpaw Usyk's body shots could be key and questions whether Fury – after a tough trilogy with Wilder and being dropped by debutant Francis Ngannou last year – has suffered too much wear and tear. \"Once the punch resistance goes, it doesn't come back and maybe he also underestimated Usyk's ability to hurt him in the first fight,\" Coldwell adds. Fury, who had already been knocked down seven times in his career, controlled most of the early rounds before he was given a standing count after an Usyk onslaught in the ninth. Fury says his tactics will remain unchanged. For Woodhall, Fury must be more disciplined and use his height and reach advantage to dictate the range against the smaller man. \"Fury and his team will work on that uppercut on the inside which didn't really land last time. Get Usyk to close the gap down and bring him on to that big punch,\" Woodhall adds. Woodhall tips Fury for the win, potentially by knockout. Pushed for a prediction, Coldwell leans towards Usyk. The post-mortem examination results brought up pretty conclusive results, yet just like the judges first time round, the experts are split on what happens next.

{"_id":{"$oid":"6762a166c3f742fb3373bb6e"},"title_or":"McIlroy and Scheffler dominate PGA-LIV 'Showdown'","description_or":"Scottie Scheffler (left) is top of the world rankings and Rory McIlroy is third PGA Tour superstars Rory McIlroy and Scottie Scheffler showed their superiority against LIV Golf pair Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka in a floodlit exhibition billed by some as a grudge match between the rival factions. With the PGA and LIV forming each side of golf's so-called civil war, 'The Showdown' was a rare chance to see four of the world's most recognisable golfers going head to head. Played on a darkening and increasingly chilly evening in Las Vegas, with the stars wearing microphones for the benefit of an American television audience, there was the promise of a different form of golfing entertainment. However, the one-sided nature of the contest - and a lack of consistent and insightful interaction between the players - meant there was not a whole deal to be left excited about. Northern Ireland's McIlroy, 35, and American world number one Scheffler, 28, never trailed in an 18-hole matchplay contest which mirrored the format of the Ryder Cup. \"We're super happy to get the win. It's a nice way to finish the year,\" McIlroy said. \"Scottie and I got off to a pretty good start and then from there it was just about trying to keep the momentum.\" Opportunities for the high-profile quartet to compete in the same field have been restricted by the PGA Tour banning LIV defectors. The four majors in men's golf - the Masters, US Open, Open Championship and PGA Championship - are predominantly the arenas where PGA and LIV players can duel. So the Showdown offered the chance to see four of the sport's biggest names - who have a combined 13 major victories between them - go head-to-head in an innovative format. The opening six holes were played as a better ball - where each player plays their own ball and the lowest score on each hole is used as the team score - with McIlroy and Scheffler clinching the winning point after just four played. The exhibition contest took place at Shadow Creek Golf Club in Las Vegas Foursomes followed on the next six holes, with each player in the team taking alternate shots. The PGA pair moved 2-0 ahead when McIlroy sunk a winning putt on the 12th. Head-to-head singles - McIlroy taking on DeChambeau and Scheffler facing Koepka - were played over the final six holes. Needing just a half to secure bragging rights, Scheffler tapped in a birdie putt on the 16th - going two up with two holes to play against Koepka - to earn the victory. \"It felt like it was a pillow fight from us,\" DeChambeau said. US players to be paid £400k for playing in Ryder Cup Matthew to captain GB&I again in 2026 Curtis Cup With the players wearing microphones throughout the event, it promised the prospect of some entertaining exchanges on the course.  The bar was set on the day before the event when DeChambeau threw a cutting barb at McIlroy over his staggering collapse at the US Open in June. McIlroy blew a two-shot lead with five holes to play at Pinehurst, missing a golden chance to end his 10-year major drought and presenting the title to DeChambeau instead. On the driving range, McIlroy attempted to ramp up the excitement by saying he wanted to face the American in the singles and avenge that chastening experience. \"I'd like to go up against Bryson and try and get him back for what he did to me at the US Open,\" he said. DeChambeau sensed his opportunity without a missing a beat. \"To be fair you kind of did it to yourself,\" came the deadpan reply. On the day itself, arguably the most amusing moment came when McIlroy and Scheffler received their winnings - a $10m cryptocurrency purse put up by the event's sponsors. \"What are you going to do with yours,\" a smirking McIlroy asked Scheffler, who won over $29m of prize money during his stunning 2024 season. \"I dunno,\" said a bemused Scheffler. The Masters champion added: \"You know, I don't know a whole lot about crypto, but this is some good motivation to do some research and figure out what is going on.\" The contest between four of the biggest names in the sport comes as the PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) - which funds LIV - continue to discuss a merger. Negotiations between the PGA Tour and the PIF have been taking place for more than a year in an attempt to end a split in the game. When a deal will be agreed remains uncertain. Relations have undoubtedly thawed, however, as evidenced by PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan playing alongside PIF governor Yassir Al-Rumayyan at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship pro-am event in October. Although the PGA Tour initially met 'The Showdown' with a degree of scepticism, there is no denying it is another step in the direction of unity. McIlroy said the purpose of the exhibition was not necessarily to act as a catalyst, but there was a sense of the players taking things into their own hands. He said: \"We want to let the fans know that we're trying to provide entertainment, that the players want to play together more often.\"","url":"https://www.bbc.com/sport/golf/articles/cgkxr4r8n2eo","published_time":"2024-12-18T09:37:12.553708Z","author_name":"","author_designation":"","reporting_location":"","images":["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/2560/cpsprodpb/1d3b/live/ad4917f0-bd1b-11ef-a076-5dfcdbd8d0db.jpg","https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/1024/cpsprodpb/9efb/live/705785a0-bd1d-11ef-a076-5dfcdbd8d0db.jpg"],"source":"bbc","category":"World","like":0,"comment":0,"share":0,"follow":0,"processed":0,"fetched_at":{"$date":"2024-12-18T15:48:12.554Z"}}
{"_id":{"$oid":"6762a166c3f742fb3373bb6f"},"title_or":"Slot v Klopp - deep dive into Liverpool's evolution","description_or":"Liverpool's transition from Jurgen Klopp to Arne Slot could barely have felt more seamless. Since swapping the German's 'heavy metal football' for an apparently more measured approach, the Reds have won 19 out of their 23 games across all competitions, losing just once. But how has Slot actually managed it? What has he changed? And what problems could lie ahead? BBC Sport takes a closer look at the tactical tweaks Liverpool have made this season. In his first few interviews with the media, Slot spoke about how both Klopp and Pep Guardiola had influenced his ideas about football. However, it is clear to see that former Brighton boss Roberto de Zerbi has also had an impact. De Zerbi's teams became famous for their way of playing through the opposition press, by asking their goalkeeper or central defenders to hold on to the ball and wait for their opponents to close them down before releasing a pass. It is a risky approach, but one which is made easier with the skills of modern keepers like Alisson and Caoimhin Kelleher. There is a great deal of patience required on the part of the centre-backs too and, in Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate, Slot has two defenders who are comfortable on the ball and more than up for the challenge. This kind of approach on the ball deeper in their own half has seen plenty of benefits already for Liverpool After 15 games in the league, the numbers show that Liverpool are looking to circulate the ball more in their own defensive third.  Last season, the Reds averaged 117.2 passes per game in their defensive third according to Opta, whereas this term that figure has gone up to 133 passes. A small tweak and Liverpool look all the better for it. Slot's team are also attempting fewer shots in each match, down to 15.2 from 20.6 last season, which is perhaps another by-product of introducing a bit more control and conservatism into the system. All of this is not to say that Liverpool do not still rely on transitions and a direct attack-led approach. Rather, the way they manufacture these advantageous scenarios for themselves has changed. Teams at the elite level these days typically set up in a 4-2-4 shape without the ball and this is something Slot has carried on from Klopp's style last season. Once again, though, this change has come with a more measured approach. In practice, Liverpool's 4-2-4 block is one that focuses on retaining structure and using that as a means of blocking favourable passing lanes to the opposition, rather than constantly pressing high to win the ball back. Liverpool's 4-2-4 shape under Slot provides coverage across the front and sets them up to take advantage of lapses from the opposition The number 10 moves up and joins the front line, which forces the opposition into doing one of two things: either play the ball long and risk turning over possession, or play the ball into the wide channels where Liverpool are comfortable pressing and winning the ball back. However, a lack of proactivity in this approach has been exploited by teams already in the Premier League, with Arsenal and Chelsea both finding ways to bypass Liverpool's front line of four and progress the ball further up the pitch centrally. Slot is aware of this issue and, for now, seems to be content with the way Liverpool's defence has dealt with the flaws. \"We want to have control of the game, we want to be very aggressive without the ball,\" he said before the Champions League tie against Bayer Leverkusen.  \"Maybe if we are not as aggressive then we are sometimes a bit too high. We still want to try, but if you're just a fraction too late or open a certain lane, then they can play through you.  \"The good thing is I always see my players running back really hard to prevent the other team from getting a chance.\" Liverpool's approach comes with flaws that still need to be ironed out - as shown above, where Arsenal winger Leandro Trossard dropped deep to aid goalkeeper David Raya in bypassing the press One of the advanced metrics on which Liverpool have dropped off is PPDA (opponent passes allowed per defensive action), which shows a relaxation in the intensity of their press. Last season, they were second in the league averaging 8.9 per game, which has risen to 10.8 this season. This means they are allowing nearly two more passes from the opposition before engaging in defensive duties. Looking at high turnovers, Liverpool ranked third last season with 392 across 38 games. So far, they have accumulated 127 and rank seventh in the league for the metric. Another interesting decline is that of dribbles challenged - how many times they tackle an opposition player who is dribbling. According to FBref, the Reds averaged a league-high 20.2 per game last season but that has gone down to 17.6. Slot wants Liverpool's players to operate higher up the pitch but without the manic aggression shown by Klopp teams of the past. Instead, it is about picking and choosing their moments to spring on the opposition. This approach feels more sustainable in the medium-to-long term, too, meaning we are less likely to see the kind of drop-off that saw them fall out of the 2023-24 title race in the latter stages. Gravenberch as a 'number six' Slot's teams have been known to set up in a 4-2-3-1 formation on the pitch, which is a move away from Klopp's favoured 4-3-3. This change in system meant a new role for Netherlands midfielder Ryan Gravenberch, who now finds himself dictating affairs from the middle of the park having been asked to play higher as a 'number eight' under Klopp. Gravenberch brings a number of strengths to the table - press-resistance, awareness of space around him both in and out of possession and a passing ability which helps connect defence and attack. His move into the 'number six' role has meant Slot has been able to use Alexis Mac Allister further up the pitch in possession. In fact, Gravenberch's role in Liverpool's side this term mirrors the Argentine's role from last season. Moving Gravenberch further back has meant he has the space to both receive and turn away from markers. His progressive carries can be of huge help to Liverpool in getting up the pitch.  However, the 22-year-old is still learning the role and has been stifled at times when pressed high by opponents - such as in the 3-3 draw at Newcastle - which can hit Liverpool's ability to build up. Back to basics for Alexander-Arnold After stepping into midfield for both club and country last season, Trent Alexander-Arnold has been playing more as a 'traditional' right-back under Slot. While this has provided more defensive stability, he has still been able to make the best of his passing talents from those deeper areas - specifically when Liverpool are trying to build out from the back or move the ball from defence to attack. Trent Alexander-Arnold is playing a more 'traditional' role this season rather than inverting into midfield - as his pass map against Bournemouth shows However, Slot has also given Alexander-Arnold licence to operate more centrally in some of the Reds' matches. Against Manchester City, for example, the 26-year-old enjoyed plenty of space in the Liverpool half to play long-ranging passes to his attackers. Not only that, when Alexander-Arnold does move into more central zones it creates one v one opportunities for Salah, while also containing any potential counter-attacking threat down the middle. Although his role has been simplified, Alexander-Arnold is still making a big difference. Salah the main man again With 22 goals and assists to his name thus far in the top flight, Mohamed Salah has started the season like he means business. According to Opta, Salah leads Liverpool for: Shots from open play per 90 - 3.15 Non-penalty expected goals per 90 (npxG) - 0.54 Shots on target per 90 - 1.76 Salah's numbers have been strong throughout his career, but this season Slot's tactical tweaks have helped leave him isolated against his marker more often.  This has a lot to do with Alexander-Arnold's role as well - either overlapping Salah to create space for the Egyptian to cut inside for a cross or shot, or inverting to pull defenders away from Salah and give him room to drive at his opponent. With nine assists in the league already, Salah is just four short of his best full-season tally for Liverpool (13 in 2021-22) - proving his worth as a creator as much as a goalscorer. In one-on-one duels, Salah will more often than not have the upper hand, and by putting him in such scenarios Liverpool are able to get more offensive output from their star player. All in all, Liverpool and Slot are in a very strong place to capitalise on the weaknesses shown by Manchester City and Arsenal this term.
