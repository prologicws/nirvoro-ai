a position Mr Cottrell held for 10 years before becoming Archbishop of York', 'During his first week in office, Mr Cottrell was fully briefed on the \"longstanding safeguarding concerns\" raised about Tudor, a spokesperson for the Archbishop said', \"Mr Cottrell would have been told: Mr Cottrell's office told the BBC that for much of his time as Bishop of Chelmsford he had been unable to take any disciplinary action because there were no complaints that hadn't already been dealt with\", 'It was not until 2019, when a fresh complaint was made against Tudor leading to a suspension, that there was \"an opportunity to remove the risk\", said a spokesperson', 'But the Bishop of Newcastle, Helen-Ann Hartley, told File on 4 Investigates that had not been an adequate response because \"any action that could have been taken\" by Mr Cottrell \"should have been vastly stronger than simply to try and manage a risk, particularly if the priest in question is already banned from working with children or entering schools\"', \"While Mr Cottrell's office maintains there were no grounds to act until 2019, the BBC can reveal that Mr Cottrell was told in 2012 about the £10,000 payout Tudor had made to Jessica, who says she was sexually abused by him, sometimes very violently, from the age of 11 during the 1970s when Tudor was training to be a minister\", 'She had brought the claim after police ended an investigation without pressing charges', '\"Nobody would make a payment if they haven\\'t got something to hide,\" says Jessica', 'Bishop Hartley says the payout was \"completely against the principles of the institution\" that Mr Cottrell is supposed to be part of and should have led to disciplinary proceedings against the priest', 'The personal payment made by Tudor \"admitted no liability\" - Mr Cottrell\\'s office told the BBC - adding that the then-Bishop of Chelmsford had been guided by \"legal advice\" that no further action could be taken', 'To compound the hurt felt by those who say they were abused as children by Tudor, three years after making his compensation payment, Tudor became an honorary canon of Chelmsford Cathedral', 'Such an appointment was \"just horrendous\" says Jessica', 'David Tudor\\'s elevation to honorary canon is something Stephen Cottrell \"regrets\", says his office, but it was \"not a promotion and not a personal reward\"', '\"It happened because of a change in Church policy during the bishop\\'s time in office, meaning area deans were automatically made honorary canons.\" But that is \"ludicrous\" says Bishop of Newcastle Helen-Ann Hartley and \"simply not good enough\"', '\"You are absolutely uplifting somebody\\'s ministry as an example and a model of good and best practice, and you\\'re celebrating that actually by making them an honorary canon.\" Rt Rev Hartley has been a lone voice in the upper echelons of the Church of England, criticising the institution\\'s failure to deal with abuse and to listen to victims', 'Last month, she became the only senior serving cleric to call for Justin Welby to step down', 'Now, she says, Stephen Cottrell should follow', \"The BBC's investigation into the David Tudor case also reveals roles played by others at the very top of the Church of England over several decades -

this time from the Church, rather than Tudor personally', 'The woman would later win a six-figure Church payout and an apology', 'Archbishop Welby had recently told all clergy that it wasn\\'t enough to say sorry about past abuse - and that they should \"take action that demonstrates clearly that we have learnt the lessons\"', 'In her letter to him, Rev Penn said she was \"struggling with the disconnect between the words and the practice\"', 'She received a response saying the matter had been reviewed', 'Rev Penn wrote again, and was again told \"the matters raised have been dealt with\"', ' She says she was \"fobbed off\"', '\"To me it was quite clear cut that this person shouldn\\'t be in post but [Mr Welby\\'s office] couldn\\'t provide a satisfactory answer as to why he was.\" The Church of England told the BBC Archbishop Welby \"took seriously the correspondence from this cleric about David Tudor\\'s permission to officiate\" and referred her concerns to the Bishop at Lambeth who was responsible for safeguarding', \"A reply to a third letter from Rev Penn to Mr Welby's office came from the Bishop of Lambeth's provincial safeguarding adviser and suggested matters raised had been dealt with\", 'Rev Penn alerted the BBC to the Tudor case after reading our story about the Church paying off a Blackburn Cathedral priest assessed as a potential risk to children', '\"I was shocked once more, and angry, that similar things had happened in another place', 'Old sins cast very long shadows,\" she says', 'Stephen Cottrell\\'s spokesperson said the Archbishop of York \"completely shares and understands the hurt and frustrations that surround this case, which were frustrations and anxieties that he lived with every day he was in office\"', 'The Church of England said the BBC File on 4 investigation \"reveals a catalogue of past safeguarding decisions, that allowed someone considered a risk in the 1980s to return to ministry in the 1990s\"', ' \"This should never have happened,\" it added', \"Among Tudor's victims, there is relief that he is no longer in a position of power after he admitted sexual misconduct at a Church tribunal in October this year and was banned for life from ministry\", '\"He should never have been let back into the Church in the first place,\" says Jessica', 'Debbie had to move away from her hometown \"to a life where nobody knew anything about my past\"', 'Holding back tears, she says she has \"lived with shame for 40 years\"', '\"It felt like he was protected', 'It was just so wrong.\" Additional reporting by Hayley Mortimer and Kirstie Brewer']\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The BBC can reveal that Mr Welby and a former Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, were also involved in the Tudor case - Mr Welby in 2018 and Lord Carey in 1993\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: David Tudor did not respond to the BBC's questions\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: At least seven women say they were abused by Tudor\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: One received six-figure compensation from the Church in 2019 and others are bringing civil claims\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Tudor worked for the Church of England for over 46 years, in London, Surrey and Essex, rising from curate to honorary canon\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: He gained a reputation for filling churches with his charismatic preaching\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: He was an area dean on Canvey Island in Essex in 2010, when Stephen Cottrell became Bishop of Chelmsford - a position Mr Cottrell held for 10 years before becoming Archbishop of York\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: During his first week in office, Mr Cottrell was fully briefed on the \"longstanding safeguarding concerns\" raised about Tudor, a spokesperson for the Archbishop said\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Cottrell would have been told: Mr Cottrell's office told the BBC that for much of his time as Bishop of Chelmsford he had been unable to take any disciplinary action because there were no complaints that hadn't already been dealt with\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It was not until 2019, when a fresh complaint was made against Tudor leading to a suspension, that there was \"an opportunity to remove the risk\", said a spokesperson\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: But the Bishop of Newcastle, Helen-Ann Hartley, told File on 4 Investigates that had not been an adequate response because \"any action that could have been taken\" by Mr Cottrell \"should have been vastly stronger than simply to try and manage a risk, particularly if the priest in question is already banned from working with children or entering schools\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: While Mr Cottrell's office maintains there were no grounds to act until 2019, the BBC can reveal that Mr Cottrell was told in 2012 about the £10,000 payout Tudor had made to Jessica, who says she was sexually abused by him, sometimes very violently, from the age of 11 during the 1970s when Tudor was training to be a minister\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"Nobody would make a payment if they haven't got something to hide,\" says Jessica\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Bishop Hartley says the payout was \"completely against the principles of the institution\" that Mr Cottrell is supposed to be part of and should have led to disciplinary proceedings against the priest\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The personal payment made by Tudor \"admitted no liability\" - Mr Cottrell's office told the BBC - adding that the then-Bishop of Chelmsford had been guided by \"legal advice\" that no further action could be taken\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: To compound the hurt felt by those who say they were abused as children by Tudor, three years after making his compensation payment, Tudor became an honorary canon of Chelmsford Cathedral\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Such an appointment was \"just horrendous\" says Jessica\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: David Tudor's elevation to honorary canon is something Stephen Cottrell \"regrets\", says his office, but it was \"not a promotion and not a personal reward\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"It happened because of a change in Church policy during the bishop's time in office, meaning area deans were automatically made honorary canons.\" But that is \"ludicrous\" says Bishop of Newcastle Helen-Ann Hartley and \"simply not good enough\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"You are absolutely uplifting somebody's ministry as an example and a model of good and best practice, and you're celebrating that actually by making them an honorary canon.\" Rt Rev Hartley has been a lone voice in the upper echelons of the Church of England, criticising the institution's failure to deal with abuse and to listen to victims\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Last month, she became the only senior serving cleric to call for Justin Welby to step down\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Now, she says, Stephen Cottrell should follow\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The BBC's investigation into the David Tudor case also reveals roles played by others at the very top of the Church of England over several decades - including former Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Debbie (not her real name) says between the ages of 13 and 15 she was sexually abused by Tudor when he was a vicar and school chaplain in Redhill, Surrey\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She was one of the three girls in his second trial in 1988\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Tudor was found guilty, but the conviction was later quashed\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It has had \"a huge effect\" on Debbie's life, she says, leaving her with complex post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which she says has been made worse by the Church's handling of the case since\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"It's absolutely disgusting that they supported him, that they welcomed him back into the Church,\" she says\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Tudor's return to the priesthood was assisted by then-Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In 1993, the archbishop - now Lord Carey - agreed that Tudor could come back under supervision the following year\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence:  This was done \"with some trepidation\", the Church of England told the BBC\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Leaked documents seen by File on 4 Investigates also show that Lord Carey agreed, in 1996, to remove the priest's name from a centrally-held record of clergy who had been subject to disciplinary proceedings\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Lord Carey said he does not remember David Tudor's name\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"We recognise these procedures were neither sufficient nor survivor-focussed, and that very different decisions would have been made today,\" Southwark diocese told the BBC\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"The decision not to impose a lifetime ban on David Tudor seems absolutely inexcusable in today's context and would not have been made today.\" The Tudor case also came across the desk of the current Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby in 2018, when Rev Jenny Penn wrote to his office questioning why the priest was still in post\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She had been a member of a \"core group\" of Church safeguarding advisers, and national and local clergy, asked to look into Tudor because another of his alleged victims involved in the 1988 trials had issued a claim for compensation - this time from the Church, rather than Tudor personally\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The woman would later win a six-figure Church payout and an apology\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Archbishop Welby had recently told all clergy that it wasn't enough to say sorry about past abuse - and that they should \"take action that demonstrates clearly that we have learnt the lessons\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In her letter to him, Rev Penn said she was \"struggling with the disconnect between the words and the practice\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She received a response saying the matter had been reviewed\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Rev Penn wrote again, and was again told \"the matters raised have been dealt with\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence:  She says she was \"fobbed off\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"To me it was quite clear cut that this person shouldn't be in post but [Mr Welby's office] couldn't provide a satisfactory answer as to why he was.\" The Church of England told the BBC Archbishop Welby \"took seriously the correspondence from this cleric about David Tudor's permission to officiate\" and referred her concerns to the Bishop at Lambeth who was responsible for safeguarding\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: A reply to a third letter from Rev Penn to Mr Welby's office came from the Bishop of Lambeth's provincial safeguarding adviser and suggested matters raised had been dealt with\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Rev Penn alerted the BBC to the Tudor case after reading our story about the Church paying off a Blackburn Cathedral priest assessed as a potential risk to children\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"I was shocked once more, and angry, that similar things had happened in another place\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Old sins cast very long shadows,\" she says\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Stephen Cottrell's spokesperson said the Archbishop of York \"completely shares and understands the hurt and frustrations that surround this case, which were frustrations and anxieties that he lived with every day he was in office\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The Church of England said the BBC File on 4 investigation \"reveals a catalogue of past safeguarding decisions, that allowed someone considered a risk in the 1980s to return to ministry in the 1990s\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence:  \"This should never have happened,\" it added\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Among Tudor's victims, there is relief that he is no longer in a position of power after he admitted sexual misconduct at a Church tribunal in October this year and was banned for life from ministry\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"He should never have been let back into the Church in the first place,\" says Jessica\n"

      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Cottrell would have been told: Mr Cottrell's office told the BBC that for much of his time as Bishop of Chelmsford he had been unable to take any disciplinary action because there were no complaints that hadn't already been dealt with\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It was not until 2019, when a fresh complaint was made against Tudor leading to a suspension, that there was \"an opportunity to remove the risk\", said a spokesperson\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: But the Bishop of Newcastle, Helen-Ann Hartley, told File on 4 Investigates that had not been an adequate response because \"any action that could have been taken\" by Mr Cottrell \"should have been vastly stronger than simply to try and manage a risk, particularly if the priest in question is already banned from working with children or entering schools\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: While Mr Cottrell's office maintains there were no grounds to act until 2019, the BBC can reveal that Mr Cottrell was told in 2012 about the £10,000 payout Tudor had made to Jessica, who says she was sexually abused by him, sometimes very violently, from the age of 11 during the 1970s when Tudor was training to be a minister\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"Nobody would make a payment if they haven't got something to hide,\" says Jessica\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Bishop Hartley says the payout was \"completely against the principles of the institution\" that Mr Cottrell is supposed to be part of and should have led to disciplinary proceedings against the priest\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The personal payment made by Tudor \"admitted no liability\" - Mr Cottrell's office told the BBC - adding that the then-Bishop of Chelmsford had been guided by \"legal advice\" that no further action could be taken\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: To compound the hurt felt by those who say they were abused as children by Tudor, three years after making his compensation payment, Tudor became an honorary canon of Chelmsford Cathedral\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Such an appointment was \"just horrendous\" says Jessica\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: David Tudor's elevation to honorary canon is something Stephen Cottrell \"regrets\", says his office, but it was \"not a promotion and not a personal reward\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"It happened because of a change in Church policy during the bishop's time in office, meaning area deans were automatically made honorary canons.\" But that is \"ludicrous\" says Bishop of Newcastle Helen-Ann Hartley and \"simply not good enough\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"You are absolutely uplifting somebody's ministry as an example and a model of good and best practice, and you're celebrating that actually by making them an honorary canon.\" Rt Rev Hartley has been a lone voice in the upper echelons of the Church of England, criticising the institution's failure to deal with abuse and to listen to victims\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Last month, she became the only senior serving cleric to call for Justin Welby to step down\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Now, she says, Stephen Cottrell should follow\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The BBC's investigation into the David Tudor case also reveals roles played by others at the very top of the Church of England over several decades - including former Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Debbie (not her real name) says between the ages of 13 and 15 she was sexually abused by Tudor when he was a vicar and school chaplain in Redhill, Surrey\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She was one of the three girls in his second trial in 1988\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Tudor was found guilty, but the conviction was later quashed\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It has had \"a huge effect\" on Debbie's life, she says, leaving her with complex post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which she says has been made worse by the Church's handling of the case since\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"It's absolutely disgusting that they supported him, that they welcomed him back into the Church,\" she says\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Tudor's return to the priesthood was assisted by then-Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In 1993, the archbishop - now Lord Carey - agreed that Tudor could come back under supervision the following year\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence:  This was done \"with some trepidation\", the Church of England told the BBC\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Leaked documents seen by File on 4 Investigates also show that Lord Carey agreed, in 1996, to remove the priest's name from a centrally-held record of clergy who had been subject to disciplinary proceedings\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Lord Carey said he does not remember David Tudor's name\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"We recognise these procedures were neither sufficient nor survivor-focussed, and that very different decisions would have been made today,\" Southwark diocese told the BBC\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"The decision not to impose a lifetime ban on David Tudor seems absolutely inexcusable in today's context and would not have been made today.\" The Tudor case also came across the desk of the current Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby in 2018, when Rev Jenny Penn wrote to his office questioning why the priest was still in post\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She had been a member of a \"core group\" of Church safeguarding advisers, and national and local clergy, asked to look into Tudor because another of his alleged victims involved in the 1988 trials had issued a claim for compensation - this time from the Church, rather than Tudor personally\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The woman would later win a six-figure Church payout and an apology\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Archbishop Welby had recently told all clergy that it wasn't enough to say sorry about past abuse - and that they should \"take action that demonstrates clearly that we have learnt the lessons\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In her letter to him, Rev Penn said she was \"struggling with the disconnect between the words and the practice\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She received a response saying the matter had been reviewed\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Rev Penn wrote again, and was again told \"the matters raised have been dealt with\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence:  She says she was \"fobbed off\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"To me it was quite clear cut that this person shouldn't be in post but [Mr Welby's office] couldn't provide a satisfactory answer as to why he was.\" The Church of England told the BBC Archbishop Welby \"took seriously the correspondence from this cleric about David Tudor's permission to officiate\" and referred her concerns to the Bishop at Lambeth who was responsible for safeguarding\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: A reply to a third letter from Rev Penn to Mr Welby's office came from the Bishop of Lambeth's provincial safeguarding adviser and suggested matters raised had been dealt with\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Rev Penn alerted the BBC to the Tudor case after reading our story about the Church paying off a Blackburn Cathedral priest assessed as a potential risk to children\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"I was shocked once more, and angry, that similar things had happened in another place\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Old sins cast very long shadows,\" she says\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Stephen Cottrell's spokesperson said the Archbishop of York \"completely shares and understands the hurt and frustrations that surround this case, which were frustrations and anxieties that he lived with every day he was in office\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The Church of England said the BBC File on 4 investigation \"reveals a catalogue of past safeguarding decisions, that allowed someone considered a risk in the 1980s to return to ministry in the 1990s\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence:  \"This should never have happened,\" it added\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Among Tudor's victims, there is relief that he is no longer in a position of power after he admitted sexual misconduct at a Church tribunal in October this year and was banned for life from ministry\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"He should never have been let back into the Church in the first place,\" says Jessica\n"

after he admitted historical sex abuse allegations relating to two girls', 'However, the Bishop of Newcastle the Rt Rev Helen-Ann Hartley says Mr Cottrell could have done more and should resign as archbishop', '\"It completely undermines his credibility that this case was not acted on,\" she told BBC File on 4 Investigates', '\"How can you have the moral and ethical authority to lead an institution with that?\" A woman who was paid £10,000 compensation by Tudor over claims he sexually abused her as a child says Mr Cottrell\\'s failure to act when he was told about the payment means he should \"leave the Church\"', '\"I feel like he [Stephen Cottrell] has spat in my face,\" says Jessica (not her real name)', 'The calls for Archbishop Cottrell to resign come at a time of turmoil in the Church of England following a damning report into how it covered up prolific abuse by the barrister John Smyth', \"The report led to the resignation of the Church's most senior figure, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby\", 'Mr Cottrell will take over his role temporarily for a few months in the New Year', 'The BBC can reveal that Mr Welby and a former Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, were also involved in the Tudor case - Mr Welby in 2018 and Lord Carey in 1993', \"David Tudor did not respond to the BBC's questions\", 'At least seven women say they were abused by Tudor', 'One received six-figure compensation from the Church in 2019 and others are bringing civil claims', 'Tudor worked for the Church of England for over 46 years, in London, Surrey and Essex, rising from curate to honorary canon', 'He gained a reputation for filling churches with his charismatic preaching', 'He was an area dean on Canvey Island in Essex in 2010, when Stephen Cottrell became Bishop of Chelmsford - a position Mr Cottrell held for 10 years before becoming Archbishop of York', 'During his first week in office, Mr Cottrell was fully briefed on the \"longstanding safeguarding concerns\" raised about Tudor, a spokesperson for the Archbishop said', \"Mr Cottrell would have been told: Mr Cottrell's office told the BBC that for much of his time as Bishop of Chelmsford he had been unable to take any disciplinary action because there were no complaints that hadn't already been dealt with\", 'It was not until 2019, when a fresh complaint was made against Tudor leading to a suspension, that there was \"an opportunity to remove the risk\", said a spokesperson', 'But the Bishop of Newcastle, Helen-Ann Hartley, told File on 4 Investigates that had not been an adequate response because \"any action that could have been taken\" by Mr Cottrell \"should have been vastly stronger than simply to try and manage a risk, particularly if the priest in question is already banned from working with children or entering schools\"', \"While Mr Cottrell's office maintains there were no grounds to act until 2019, the BBC can reveal that Mr Cottrell was told in 2012 about the £10,000 payout Tudor had made to Jessica, who says she was sexually abused by him, sometimes very violently, from the age of 11 during the 1970s when Tudor was training to be a minister\", 'She had brought the claim after police ended an investigation without pressing charges', '\"Nobody would make a payment if they haven\\'t got something to hide,\" says Jessica', 'Bishop Hartley says the payout was \"completely against the principles of the institution\" that Mr Cottrell is supposed to be part of and should have led to disciplinary proceedings against the priest', 'The personal payment made by Tudor \"admitted no liability\" - Mr Cottrell\\'s office told the BBC - adding that the then-Bishop of Chelmsford had been guided by \"legal advice\" that no further action could be taken', 'To compound the hurt felt by those who say they were abused as children by Tudor, three years after making his compensation payment, Tudor became an honorary canon of Chelmsford Cathedral', 'Such an appointment was \"just horrendous\" says Jessica', 'David Tudor\\'s elevation to honorary canon is something Stephen Cottrell \"regrets\", says his office, but it was \"not a promotion and not a personal reward\"', '\"It happened because of a change in Church policy during the bishop\\'s time in office, meaning area deans were automatically made honorary canons.\" But that is \"ludicrous\" says Bishop of Newcastle Helen-Ann Hartley and \"simply not good enough\"', '\"You are absolutely uplifting somebody\\'s ministry as an example and a model of good and best practice, and you\\'re celebrating that actually by making them an honorary canon.\" Rt Rev Hartley has been a lone voice in the upper echelons of the Church of England, criticising the institution\\'s failure to deal with abuse and to listen to victims', 'Last month, she became the only senior serving cleric to call for Justin Welby to step down', 'Now, she says, Stephen Cottrell should follow', \"The BBC's investigation into the David Tudor case also reveals roles played by others at the very top of the Church of England over several decades - including former Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey\", 'Debbie (not her real name) says between the ages of 13 and 15 she was sexually abused by Tudor when he was a vicar and school chaplain in Redhill, Surrey', 'She was one of the three girls in his second trial in 1988', 'Tudor was found guilty, but the conviction was later quashed', 'It has had \"a huge effect\" on Debbie\\'s life, she says, leaving her with complex post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which she says has been made worse by the Church\\'s handling of the case since', '\"It\\'s absolutely disgusting that they supported him, that they welcomed him back into the Church,\" she says', \"Tudor's return to the priesthood was assisted by then-Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey\", 'In 1993, the archbishop -

      "Skipping sensational sentence: David Tudor's elevation to honorary canon is something Stephen Cottrell \"regrets\", says his office, but it was \"not a promotion and not a personal reward\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"It happened because of a change in Church policy during the bishop's time in office, meaning area deans were automatically made honorary canons.\" But that is \"ludicrous\" says Bishop of Newcastle Helen-Ann Hartley and \"simply not good enough\"\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Announcing the agreement, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was evidence of the government's commitment to \"working towards ensuring a financially stable Royal Mail with protected links between communities other providers can't reach\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings that demonstrate the high regard EP Group has for Royal Mail\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"EP Group is a long term and committed investor with a mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers,\" he added\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It has also made commitments to unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover was called in for review under national security laws as it is considered vital national infrastructure\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Last week, Royal Mail was fined £10.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would \"absolutely\" hold Royal Mail to account\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Looking ahead she said there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Following Friday's fine, IDS said it had carried out \"substantial\" reforms this year to try to drive improvements\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Meanwhile, parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: IDS made a small profit last year which was entirely generated by its German and Canadian logistics and parcels business, off-setting losses at Royal Mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he intends to invest heavily in the roll out of delivery lockers to make online deliveries more efficient as has happened across Europe\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more housing\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: A paper to be published on Monday is expected to set an ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Streamlining local government will be presented as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, regarded by Labour as a means to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\"\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Announcing the agreement, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was evidence of the government's commitment to \"working towards ensuring a financially stable Royal Mail with protected links between communities other providers can't reach\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings that demonstrate the high regard EP Group has for Royal Mail\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"EP Group is a long term and committed investor with a mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers,\" he added\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It has also made commitments to unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover was called in for review under national security laws as it is considered vital national infrastructure\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Last week, Royal Mail was fined £10.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would \"absolutely\" hold Royal Mail to account\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Looking ahead she said there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Following Friday's fine, IDS said it had carried out \"substantial\" reforms this year to try to drive improvements\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Meanwhile, parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: IDS made a small profit last year which was entirely generated by its German and Canadian logistics and parcels business, off-setting losses at Royal Mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he intends to invest heavily in the roll out of delivery lockers to make online deliveries more efficient as has happened across Europe\n"

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more housing\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: A paper to be published on Monday is expected to set an ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Streamlining local government will be presented as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, regarded by Labour as a means to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\"\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Announcing the agreement, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was evidence of the government's commitment to \"working towards ensuring a financially stable Royal Mail with protected links between communities other providers can't reach\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings that demonstrate the high regard EP Group has for Royal Mail\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"EP Group is a long term and committed investor with a mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers,\" he added\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It has also made commitments to unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover was called in for review under national security laws as it is considered vital national infrastructure\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Last week, Royal Mail was fined £10.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would \"absolutely\" hold Royal Mail to account\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Looking ahead she said there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Following Friday's fine, IDS said it had carried out \"substantial\" reforms this year to try to drive improvements\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Meanwhile, parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: IDS made a small profit last year which was entirely generated by its German and Canadian logistics and parcels business, off-setting losses at Royal Mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he intends to invest heavily in the roll out of delivery lockers to make online deliveries more efficient as has happened across Europe\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more housing\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: A paper to be published on Monday is expected to set an ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Streamlining local government will be presented as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, regarded by Labour as a means to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\"\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Announcing the agreement, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was evidence of the government's commitment to \"working towards ensuring a financially stable Royal Mail with protected links between communities other providers can't reach\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings that demonstrate the high regard EP Group has for Royal Mail\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"EP Group is a long term and committed investor with a mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers,\" he added\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It has also made commitments to unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover was called in for review under national security laws as it is considered vital national infrastructure\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Last week, Royal Mail was fined £10.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would \"absolutely\" hold Royal Mail to account\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Looking ahead she said there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Following Friday's fine, IDS said it had carried out \"substantial\" reforms this year to try to drive improvements\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Meanwhile, parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: IDS made a small profit last year which was entirely generated by its German and Canadian logistics and parcels business, off-setting losses at Royal Mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he intends to invest heavily in the roll out of delivery lockers to make online deliveries more efficient as has happened across Europe\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more housing\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: A paper to be published on Monday is expected to set an ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Streamlining local government will be presented as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, regarded by Labour as a means to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\"\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Announcing the agreement, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was evidence of the government's commitment to \"working towards ensuring a financially stable Royal Mail with protected links between communities other providers can't reach\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings that demonstrate the high regard EP Group has for Royal Mail\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"EP Group is a long term and committed investor with a mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers,\" he added\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It has also made commitments to unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover was called in for review under national security laws as it is considered vital national infrastructure\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Last week, Royal Mail was fined £10.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would \"absolutely\" hold Royal Mail to account\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Looking ahead she said there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Following Friday's fine, IDS said it had carried out \"substantial\" reforms this year to try to drive improvements\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Meanwhile, parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: IDS made a small profit last year which was entirely generated by its German and Canadian logistics and parcels business, off-setting losses at Royal Mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he intends to invest heavily in the roll out of delivery lockers to make online deliveries more efficient as has happened across Europe\n"

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more housing\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: A paper to be published on Monday is expected to set an ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Streamlining local government will be presented as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, regarded by Labour as a means to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\"\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Announcing the agreement, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was evidence of the government's commitment to \"working towards ensuring a financially stable Royal Mail with protected links between communities other providers can't reach\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings that demonstrate the high regard EP Group has for Royal Mail\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"EP Group is a long term and committed investor with a mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers,\" he added\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It has also made commitments to unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover was called in for review under national security laws as it is considered vital national infrastructure\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Last week, Royal Mail was fined £10.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would \"absolutely\" hold Royal Mail to account\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Looking ahead she said there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Following Friday's fine, IDS said it had carried out \"substantial\" reforms this year to try to drive improvements\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Meanwhile, parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: IDS made a small profit last year which was entirely generated by its German and Canadian logistics and parcels business, off-setting losses at Royal Mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he intends to invest heavily in the roll out of delivery lockers to make online deliveries more efficient as has happened across Europe\n"

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more housing\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: A paper to be published on Monday is expected to set an ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Streamlining local government will be presented as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, regarded by Labour as a means to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\"\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Announcing the agreement, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was evidence of the government's commitment to \"working towards ensuring a financially stable Royal Mail with protected links between communities other providers can't reach\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings that demonstrate the high regard EP Group has for Royal Mail\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"EP Group is a long term and committed investor with a mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers,\" he added\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It has also made commitments to unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover was called in for review under national security laws as it is considered vital national infrastructure\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Last week, Royal Mail was fined £10.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would \"absolutely\" hold Royal Mail to account\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Looking ahead she said there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Following Friday's fine, IDS said it had carried out \"substantial\" reforms this year to try to drive improvements\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Meanwhile, parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: IDS made a small profit last year which was entirely generated by its German and Canadian logistics and parcels business, off-setting losses at Royal Mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he intends to invest heavily in the roll out of delivery lockers to make online deliveries more efficient as has happened across Europe\n"

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more housing\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: A paper to be published on Monday is expected to set an ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Streamlining local government will be presented as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, regarded by Labour as a means to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\"\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Announcing the agreement, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was evidence of the government's commitment to \"working towards ensuring a financially stable Royal Mail with protected links between communities other providers can't reach\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings that demonstrate the high regard EP Group has for Royal Mail\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"EP Group is a long term and committed investor with a mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers,\" he added\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It has also made commitments to unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover was called in for review under national security laws as it is considered vital national infrastructure\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Last week, Royal Mail was fined £10.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would \"absolutely\" hold Royal Mail to account\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Looking ahead she said there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Following Friday's fine, IDS said it had carried out \"substantial\" reforms this year to try to drive improvements\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Meanwhile, parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: IDS made a small profit last year which was entirely generated by its German and Canadian logistics and parcels business, off-setting losses at Royal Mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he intends to invest heavily in the roll out of delivery lockers to make online deliveries more efficient as has happened across Europe\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Daniel Kretinsky started his career as a lawyer in his hometown of Brno, before moving to Prague\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: He then made serious money in Central and Eastern European energy interests\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more housing\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: A paper to be published on Monday is expected to set an ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Streamlining local government will be presented as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, regarded by Labour as a means to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\"\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Announcing the agreement, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was evidence of the government's commitment to \"working towards ensuring a financially stable Royal Mail with protected links between communities other providers can't reach\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings that demonstrate the high regard EP Group has for Royal Mail\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"EP Group is a long term and committed investor with a mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers,\" he added\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It has also made commitments to unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover was called in for review under national security laws as it is considered vital national infrastructure\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Last week, Royal Mail was fined £10.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would \"absolutely\" hold Royal Mail to account\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Looking ahead she said there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Following Friday's fine, IDS said it had carried out \"substantial\" reforms this year to try to drive improvements\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Meanwhile, parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: IDS made a small profit last year which was entirely generated by its German and Canadian logistics and parcels business, off-setting losses at Royal Mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he intends to invest heavily in the roll out of delivery lockers to make online deliveries more efficient as has happened across Europe\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more housing\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: A paper to be published on Monday is expected to set an ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Streamlining local government will be presented as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, regarded by Labour as a means to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\"\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Announcing the agreement, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was evidence of the government's commitment to \"working towards ensuring a financially stable Royal Mail with protected links between communities other providers can't reach\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings that demonstrate the high regard EP Group has for Royal Mail\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"EP Group is a long term and committed investor with a mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers,\" he added\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It has also made commitments to unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover was called in for review under national security laws as it is considered vital national infrastructure\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Last week, Royal Mail was fined £10.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would \"absolutely\" hold Royal Mail to account\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Looking ahead she said there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Following Friday's fine, IDS said it had carried out \"substantial\" reforms this year to try to drive improvements\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Meanwhile, parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: IDS made a small profit last year which was entirely generated by its German and Canadian logistics and parcels business, off-setting losses at Royal Mail\n"

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more housing\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: A paper to be published on Monday is expected to set an ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Streamlining local government will be presented as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, regarded by Labour as a means to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\"\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Announcing the agreement, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was evidence of the government's commitment to \"working towards ensuring a financially stable Royal Mail with protected links between communities other providers can't reach\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings that demonstrate the high regard EP Group has for Royal Mail\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"EP Group is a long term and committed investor with a mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers,\" he added\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It has also made commitments to unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover was called in for review under national security laws as it is considered vital national infrastructure\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Last week, Royal Mail was fined £10.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would \"absolutely\" hold Royal Mail to account\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Looking ahead she said there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Following Friday's fine, IDS said it had carried out \"substantial\" reforms this year to try to drive improvements\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Meanwhile, parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: IDS made a small profit last year which was entirely generated by its German and Canadian logistics and parcels business, off-setting losses at Royal Mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he intends to invest heavily in the roll out of delivery lockers to make online deliveries more efficient as has happened across Europe\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more housing\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: A paper to be published on Monday is expected to set an ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Streamlining local government will be presented as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, regarded by Labour as a means to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\"\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Announcing the agreement, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was evidence of the government's commitment to \"working towards ensuring a financially stable Royal Mail with protected links between communities other providers can't reach\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings that demonstrate the high regard EP Group has for Royal Mail\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"EP Group is a long term and committed investor with a mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers,\" he added\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It has also made commitments to unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover was called in for review under national security laws as it is considered vital national infrastructure\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Last week, Royal Mail was fined £10.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would \"absolutely\" hold Royal Mail to account\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Looking ahead she said there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Following Friday's fine, IDS said it had carried out \"substantial\" reforms this year to try to drive improvements\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Meanwhile, parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: IDS made a small profit last year which was entirely generated by its German and Canadian logistics and parcels business, off-setting losses at Royal Mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he intends to invest heavily in the roll out of delivery lockers to make online deliveries more efficient as has happened across Europe\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more housing\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: A paper to be published on Monday is expected to set an ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Streamlining local government will be presented as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, regarded by Labour as a means to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\"\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Announcing the agreement, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was evidence of the government's commitment to \"working towards ensuring a financially stable Royal Mail with protected links between communities other providers can't reach\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings that demonstrate the high regard EP Group has for Royal Mail\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"EP Group is a long term and committed investor with a mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers,\" he added\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It has also made commitments to unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover was called in for review under national security laws as it is considered vital national infrastructure\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Last week, Royal Mail was fined £10.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would \"absolutely\" hold Royal Mail to account\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Looking ahead she said there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Following Friday's fine, IDS said it had carried out \"substantial\" reforms this year to try to drive improvements\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Meanwhile, parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: IDS made a small profit last year which was entirely generated by its German and Canadian logistics and parcels business, off-setting losses at Royal Mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he intends to invest heavily in the roll out of delivery lockers to make online deliveries more efficient as has happened across Europe\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more housing\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: A paper to be published on Monday is expected to set an ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Streamlining local government will be presented as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, regarded by Labour as a means to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\"\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Announcing the agreement, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was evidence of the government's commitment to \"working towards ensuring a financially stable Royal Mail with protected links between communities other providers can't reach\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings that demonstrate the high regard EP Group has for Royal Mail\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"EP Group is a long term and committed investor with a mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers,\" he added\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It has also made commitments to unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover was called in for review under national security laws as it is considered vital national infrastructure\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Last week, Royal Mail was fined £10.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would \"absolutely\" hold Royal Mail to account\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Looking ahead she said there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Following Friday's fine, IDS said it had carried out \"substantial\" reforms this year to try to drive improvements\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Meanwhile, parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: IDS made a small profit last year which was entirely generated by its German and Canadian logistics and parcels business, off-setting losses at Royal Mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he intends to invest heavily in the roll out of delivery lockers to make online deliveries more efficient as has happened across Europe\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more housing\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: A paper to be published on Monday is expected to set an ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Streamlining local government will be presented as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, regarded by Labour as a means to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\"\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Announcing the agreement, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was evidence of the government's commitment to \"working towards ensuring a financially stable Royal Mail with protected links between communities other providers can't reach\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings that demonstrate the high regard EP Group has for Royal Mail\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"EP Group is a long term and committed investor with a mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers,\" he added\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It has also made commitments to unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover was called in for review under national security laws as it is considered vital national infrastructure\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Last week, Royal Mail was fined £10.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would \"absolutely\" hold Royal Mail to account\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Looking ahead she said there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Following Friday's fine, IDS said it had carried out \"substantial\" reforms this year to try to drive improvements\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Meanwhile, parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: IDS made a small profit last year which was entirely generated by its German and Canadian logistics and parcels business, off-setting losses at Royal Mail\n"

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Announcing the agreement, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was evidence of the government's commitment to \"working towards ensuring a financially stable Royal Mail with protected links between communities other providers can't reach\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings that demonstrate the high regard EP Group has for Royal Mail\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"EP Group is a long term and committed investor with a mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers,\" he added\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It has also made commitments to unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover was called in for review under national security laws as it is considered vital national infrastructure\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Last week, Royal Mail was fined £10.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would \"absolutely\" hold Royal Mail to account\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Looking ahead she said there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Following Friday's fine, IDS said it had carried out \"substantial\" reforms this year to try to drive improvements\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Meanwhile, parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: IDS made a small profit last year which was entirely generated by its German and Canadian logistics and parcels business, off-setting losses at Royal Mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he intends to invest heavily in the roll out of delivery lockers to make online deliveries more efficient as has happened across Europe\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more housing\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: A paper to be published on Monday is expected to set an ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Streamlining local government will be presented as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, regarded by Labour as a means to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\"\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Announcing the agreement, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was evidence of the government's commitment to \"working towards ensuring a financially stable Royal Mail with protected links between communities other providers can't reach\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings that demonstrate the high regard EP Group has for Royal Mail\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"EP Group is a long term and committed investor with a mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers,\" he added\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It has also made commitments to unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover was called in for review under national security laws as it is considered vital national infrastructure\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Last week, Royal Mail was fined £10.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would \"absolutely\" hold Royal Mail to account\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Looking ahead she said there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Following Friday's fine, IDS said it had carried out \"substantial\" reforms this year to try to drive improvements\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Meanwhile, parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: IDS made a small profit last year which was entirely generated by its German and Canadian logistics and parcels business, off-setting losses at Royal Mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he intends to invest heavily in the roll out of delivery lockers to make online deliveries more efficient as has happened across Europe\n"

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more housing\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: A paper to be published on Monday is expected to set an ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Streamlining local government will be presented as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, regarded by Labour as a means to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\"\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Announcing the agreement, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was evidence of the government's commitment to \"working towards ensuring a financially stable Royal Mail with protected links between communities other providers can't reach\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings that demonstrate the high regard EP Group has for Royal Mail\"\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It has also made commitments to unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover was called in for review under national security laws as it is considered vital national infrastructure\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Last week, Royal Mail was fined £10.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would \"absolutely\" hold Royal Mail to account\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Looking ahead she said there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Following Friday's fine, IDS said it had carried out \"substantial\" reforms this year to try to drive improvements\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Meanwhile, parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: IDS made a small profit last year which was entirely generated by its German and Canadian logistics and parcels business, off-setting losses at Royal Mail\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more housing\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: A paper to be published on Monday is expected to set an ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Streamlining local government will be presented as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, regarded by Labour as a means to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\"\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Announcing the agreement, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was evidence of the government's commitment to \"working towards ensuring a financially stable Royal Mail with protected links between communities other providers can't reach\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings that demonstrate the high regard EP Group has for Royal Mail\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"EP Group is a long term and committed investor with a mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers,\" he added\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It has also made commitments to unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover was called in for review under national security laws as it is considered vital national infrastructure\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Last week, Royal Mail was fined £10.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would \"absolutely\" hold Royal Mail to account\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Looking ahead she said there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Following Friday's fine, IDS said it had carried out \"substantial\" reforms this year to try to drive improvements\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Meanwhile, parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: IDS made a small profit last year which was entirely generated by its German and Canadian logistics and parcels business, off-setting losses at Royal Mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he intends to invest heavily in the roll out of delivery lockers to make online deliveries more efficient as has happened across Europe\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more housing\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: A paper to be published on Monday is expected to set an ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Streamlining local government will be presented as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, regarded by Labour as a means to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\"\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Announcing the agreement, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was evidence of the government's commitment to \"working towards ensuring a financially stable Royal Mail with protected links between communities other providers can't reach\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings that demonstrate the high regard EP Group has for Royal Mail\"\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It has also made commitments to unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover was called in for review under national security laws as it is considered vital national infrastructure\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Last week, Royal Mail was fined £10.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would \"absolutely\" hold Royal Mail to account\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Looking ahead she said there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Following Friday's fine, IDS said it had carried out \"substantial\" reforms this year to try to drive improvements\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Meanwhile, parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: IDS made a small profit last year which was entirely generated by its German and Canadian logistics and parcels business, off-setting losses at Royal Mail\n"

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more housing\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: A paper to be published on Monday is expected to set an ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Streamlining local government will be presented as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, regarded by Labour as a means to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\"\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Announcing the agreement, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was evidence of the government's commitment to \"working towards ensuring a financially stable Royal Mail with protected links between communities other providers can't reach\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings that demonstrate the high regard EP Group has for Royal Mail\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"EP Group is a long term and committed investor with a mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers,\" he added\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It has also made commitments to unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover was called in for review under national security laws as it is considered vital national infrastructure\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Last week, Royal Mail was fined £10.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would \"absolutely\" hold Royal Mail to account\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Looking ahead she said there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Following Friday's fine, IDS said it had carried out \"substantial\" reforms this year to try to drive improvements\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Meanwhile, parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: IDS made a small profit last year which was entirely generated by its German and Canadian logistics and parcels business, off-setting losses at Royal Mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he intends to invest heavily in the roll out of delivery lockers to make online deliveries more efficient as has happened across Europe\n"

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more housing\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: A paper to be published on Monday is expected to set an ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Streamlining local government will be presented as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, regarded by Labour as a means to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\"\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Announcing the agreement, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was evidence of the government's commitment to \"working towards ensuring a financially stable Royal Mail with protected links between communities other providers can't reach\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings that demonstrate the high regard EP Group has for Royal Mail\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"EP Group is a long term and committed investor with a mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers,\" he added\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It has also made commitments to unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover was called in for review under national security laws as it is considered vital national infrastructure\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Last week, Royal Mail was fined £10.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would \"absolutely\" hold Royal Mail to account\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Looking ahead she said there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Following Friday's fine, IDS said it had carried out \"substantial\" reforms this year to try to drive improvements\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Meanwhile, parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: IDS made a small profit last year which was entirely generated by its German and Canadian logistics and parcels business, off-setting losses at Royal Mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he intends to invest heavily in the roll out of delivery lockers to make online deliveries more efficient as has happened across Europe\n"

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more housing\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: A paper to be published on Monday is expected to set an ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Streamlining local government will be presented as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, regarded by Labour as a means to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\"\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Announcing the agreement, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was evidence of the government's commitment to \"working towards ensuring a financially stable Royal Mail with protected links between communities other providers can't reach\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings that demonstrate the high regard EP Group has for Royal Mail\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"EP Group is a long term and committed investor with a mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers,\" he added\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It has also made commitments to unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover was called in for review under national security laws as it is considered vital national infrastructure\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Last week, Royal Mail was fined £10.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would \"absolutely\" hold Royal Mail to account\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Looking ahead she said there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Following Friday's fine, IDS said it had carried out \"substantial\" reforms this year to try to drive improvements\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Meanwhile, parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: IDS made a small profit last year which was entirely generated by its German and Canadian logistics and parcels business, off-setting losses at Royal Mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he intends to invest heavily in the roll out of delivery lockers to make online deliveries more efficient as has happened across Europe\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Daniel Kretinsky started his career as a lawyer in his hometown of Brno, before moving to Prague\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: He then made serious money in Central and Eastern European energy interests\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence:  He then diversified into other investments, including an almost 10% stake in UK supermarket chain Sainsbury's and a 27% share in Premier League club West Ham United\n"

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more housing\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: A paper to be published on Monday is expected to set an ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Streamlining local government will be presented as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, regarded by Labour as a means to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\"\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more housing\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: A paper to be published on Monday is expected to set an ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Streamlining local government will be presented as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, regarded by Labour as a means to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\"\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Announcing the agreement, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was evidence of the government's commitment to \"working towards ensuring a financially stable Royal Mail with protected links between communities other providers can't reach\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings that demonstrate the high regard EP Group has for Royal Mail\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"EP Group is a long term and committed investor with a mission to make Royal Mail a successful modern postal operator with high quality service and products for its customers,\" he added\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It has also made commitments to unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover was called in for review under national security laws as it is considered vital national infrastructure\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Last week, Royal Mail was fined £10.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would \"absolutely\" hold Royal Mail to account\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Looking ahead she said there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Following Friday's fine, IDS said it had carried out \"substantial\" reforms this year to try to drive improvements\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Meanwhile, parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: IDS made a small profit last year which was entirely generated by its German and Canadian logistics and parcels business, off-setting losses at Royal Mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he intends to invest heavily in the roll out of delivery lockers to make online deliveries more efficient as has happened across Europe\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Daniel Kretinsky started his career as a lawyer in his hometown of Brno, before moving to Prague\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: He then made serious money in Central and Eastern European energy interests\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more housing\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: A paper to be published on Monday is expected to set an ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Streamlining local government will be presented as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, regarded by Labour as a means to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\"\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The USO is currently under review, with Royal Mail suggesting to regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Announcing the agreement, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said it was evidence of the government's commitment to \"working towards ensuring a financially stable Royal Mail with protected links between communities other providers can't reach\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Mr Kretinsky said the talks with the government had \"resulted in unprecedented commitments and undertakings that demonstrate the high regard EP Group has for Royal Mail\"\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover of Royal Mail's parent company, International Distribution Services (IDS), is expected to be completed early next year\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The conditions agreed by EP Group include keeping the brand name and Royal Mail's headquarters and tax residency in the UK for the next five years\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It has also made commitments to unions that include workers getting a 10% share of any dividends paid out to Mr Kretinsky, as well as the formation of a workers group that will meet monthly with the directors of Royal Mail to give employees a bigger voice on how it is run\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes much reduced levels of Russian gas to Europe, paid for and with the consent of the EU\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The takeover was called in for review under national security laws as it is considered vital national infrastructure\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Speaking in front of MPs in November, Reynolds had referred to Mr Kretinsky as a \"legitimate business figure\" whose alleged links to Russia had already been reviewed and dismissed when he became the biggest shareholder in the company nearly two years ago\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Royal Mail, which was split from the Post Office and privatised a decade ago, has seen its performance deteriorate in recent years, leading to heavy financial losses\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Last week, Royal Mail was fined £10.5m by the regulator Ofcom for failing to meet delivery targets for first and second class mail\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC it was up to the new ownership to deliver on improvements and the regulator would \"absolutely\" hold Royal Mail to account\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Looking ahead she said there were \"real questions about what the service needs to be going into the future\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Given letter numbers are falling \"we have to think about what is economical\", adding Ofcom would be publishing plans next year \"to make sure it is sustainable\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Following Friday's fine, IDS said it had carried out \"substantial\" reforms this year to try to drive improvements\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The volume of letters being posted in the UK has plummeted, with half the number being sent compared to 2011 levels\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Meanwhile, parcel deliveries have become more popular - and more profitable\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: IDS made a small profit last year which was entirely generated by its German and Canadian logistics and parcels business, off-setting losses at Royal Mail\n"

      "Skipping sensational sentence: The Labour government pledged to extend the use of local powers before the election, as a key part of its wider targets to grow the economy and build more housing\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: A paper to be published on Monday is expected to set an ambition to move towards unitary councils across all of England, with areas that currently have two tiers being asked to draw up merger proposals\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Streamlining local government will be presented as a way to enable the creation of more powerful local mayors, regarded by Labour as a means to unblock infrastructure and attract greater investment\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Dozens of district councils could be abolished as a result – prompting some to claim it would deprive people of genuinely localised decision-making\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It would require a series of deals nationwide emulating North Yorkshire, which now has a unitary authority after eight councils were merged together last year\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence:  This would mark a scale of reorganisation that goes beyond what Labour promised in its election manifesto, and mark arguably the biggest shake-up of local government since the 1970s\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The overall timetable and route to achieving this has not been confirmed - and it is not yet clear if the government will use legal powers to force councils together, or hope to encourage them to do so through funding arrangements\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In a speech on Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner will vow to make devolution the \"default position of government\", and give councils the powers they need to \"drive growth and raise living standards\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: She also warned the reorganisation could spark a \"period of turmoil which will prevent councils from focusing on the local services that drive new homes, jobs and reduce pressure on the NHS\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: A Conservative Party spokesman said Rayner's announcement is part of a plan to \"strip councils of their powers\" and to impose reorganisation from Westminster \"without local consent\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"This new announcement will do nothing to solve that - and instead open up another front on Labour's assault on the countryside.\" The Liberal Democrats said council budgets were \"on the brink\" and without properly investing in social care more vital services would disappear\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence:  The plans, however, have been welcomed by the County Councils Network, which says its members \"now recognise the need to embrace the benefits\" of devolution in the face of \"significant financial challenges\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Its chairman Tim Oliver said it had become clear that in many county areas, reorganisation was needed to \"unlock\" more generous funding from central government and create \"more financially sustainable\" councils\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Cllr Louise Gittins, chair of the Local Government Association, said \"genuine devolution of powers and resources can play a huge role in promoting inclusive economic growth, creating jobs, and improving public services\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Lord Houchen, the Conservative mayor of Tees Valley, welcomed the plans, including greater powers over transport and planning\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: However, he told the BBC they could go further by giving more control over post-16 education, to make sure local people had the right skills for jobs being created in the area\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence:  Monday's paper is also expected to confirm plans for increased co-operation between councils in planning for transport and infrastructure projects\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Upper-tier councils, including unitary authorities and current county councils, will be required to produce slimmed-down versions of the \"spatial development\" strategies used to plan for projects in big cities\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Since returning to office in July, Labour has announced four devolution deals:  Greater Lincolnshire, Hull and East Yorkshire, Devon and Torbay, and Lancashire\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Combined authorities, including combined county authorities in more rural areas, are more advanced in the north of England compared to the south\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: There has been a weaker appetite for devolution deals in swathes of the south-west and East Anglia, where minimum population requirements would also necessitate the creation of larger combined councils\n",
