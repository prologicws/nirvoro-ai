who is in Russia so didn't want to be named - told the BBC\", 'Even if they did number 3,000, it would not be big in a battlefield sense, but the US is as concerned as Ukraine', '“It would mark a significant increase in their relationship,” said US state department spokesman Matthew Miller,  who saw it as “a new level of desperation by Russia” amid battlefield losses', 'It was back in June that Vladimir Putin toasted a “peaceful and defensive” pact with Kim Jong Un', 'And there is mounting evidence that North Korea is supplying Russia with ammunition, as recently demonstrated by the recovery of a missile in Ukraine’s Poltava region', 'In fact, reports of mines and shells supplied by Pyongyang date back to December 2023 in Telegram chats involving Russia’s military communities', 'Russian soldiers, stationed in Ukraine, have often complained about the standard of ammunition and that dozens of soldiers have been wounded', 'Kyiv suspects that a unit of North Korean soldiers is preparing in the Ulan-Ude region close to the Mongolian border ahead of deployment to Russia’s Kursk province, where Ukrainian forces launched an incursion back in August', '“They could guard some sections of the Russian-Ukrainian border, which would free Russian units for fighting elsewhere,” said Valeriy Ryabykh, editor of the Ukrainian publication Defence Express', '“I would rule out the possibility that these units will immediately appear on the front line.” Ryabakh is not alone in this thought', 'North Korea may have some 1.28 million active soldiers but its army has no recent experience of combat operations, unlike Russia’s military', ' Pyongyang has pursued the old Soviet model in its armed forces but it is unclear how its main force of motorised infantry units might fit into the war in Ukraine', 'Then there is the obvious language barrier and an unfamiliarity with Russian systems that would complicate any fighting roles', 'That does not preclude North Korea’s military taking part in Russia’s full-scale war in Ukraine, but they are most recognised by experts for their engineering and construction abilities, not for fighting', 'What they do both have are shared incentives', 'Pyongyang needs money and technology, Moscow needs soldiers and ammunition', '“Pyongyang would be paid well and maybe get access to Russian military technology, which otherwise Moscow would have been reluctant to transfer to North Korea,” says Andrei Lankov, director of the Korea Risk Group', '“It would also give their soldiers real combat experience, but there is also the risk of exposing North Koreans to life in the West, which is a considerably more prosperous place.” For Putin, there is an urgent need to make up for significant losses during more than two and half years of war', 'Valeriy Akimenko from the UK’s Conflict Studies Research Centre believes deploying North Koreans would help the Russian leader deal with the previous round of mandatory mobilisation not going well', '“So he thinks, as the Russian ranks are thinned out by Ukraine, what a brilliant idea - why not let North Koreans do some of the fighting?” President Zelensky is clearly concerned about how this hostile alliance could evolve', 'There have not been Western boots on the ground in Ukraine for fear of escalation', 'However, if reports of hundreds of North Koreans preparing for deployment are borne out, the idea of foreign boots on the ground in this war would appear to be less of a concern for Vladimir Putin', 'Additional reporting by Paul Kirby, Kelly Ng and Nick Marsh.']\n",

Her latest feature has minor elements of body horror - the mother grows fur, extra nipples and a tail - but is a walk in the park compared with Demi Moore's recent film The Substance\", 'Adams has previously starred in films including Arrival, Nocturnal Animals, American Hustle, Dear Evan Hansen, Vice and The Woman in the Window', \"Heller and Adams walked the red carpet ahead of Nightbitch's UK premiere at London's Royal Festival Hall on Wednesday\", 'In an interview with Vanity Fair, Adams said she thought Yoder\\'s novel was \"unique and otherworldly, and like nothing I\\'d ever read before\", adding: \"The thing I really attached to is this idea of loss of identity.\" Reflecting on her character\\'s journey in the film, Adams explained: \"Through her parenting - through her mothering - she got in touch with something bigger and something primal.\" The 98-minute film has received broadly positive reviews, although some critics suggested not every idea explored in the film fulfils its potential', ' \"Part of the brilliance of Nightbitch,\" Lenker said in her review, \"is the ways it doesn\\'t stop at showcasing the isolation and loneliness of motherhood, cut off from a previous version of oneself and one\\'s life', 'It takes this fable a step further.\" She described Heller and Adams as \"a dynamic pair, finding ways to punctuate their bizarre tale with brutal honesty, off-the-wall humour, and a desire to celebrate the messiness and magic of motherhood\"', '\"Loving your child but hating motherhood is a conflict that Heller captures with an honesty that we often don’t see,\" noted Pajiba\\'s Sara Clements', '\"Mother is a character whose transformation presents a rawness in its unglamorous truths, with Adams delivering a beast of a performance.\" Jourdain Searles of Little White Lies added: \"As corny as Nightbitch can be, there\\'s no denying the universal truths behind the narrative.\" Elsewhere, Nadia Dalimonte of Next Best Picture wrote: \"While Heller struggles to balance the visual concept with its philosophical themes, her compassionate sensibilities bring Nightbitch home.\" However, Natalia Keogan of the AV Club said the \"mundane\" film somewhat underdelivered on its potential', '\"It’s normal to become excited when one\\'s experience appears to be accurately represented on screen, but a successful film needs to be more than merely a mirror,\" she said', '\"While it emphasises the unsung and vital presence of mothers, Nightbitch doesn\\'t probe the broader societal devaluation that actually causes women to feel unfulfilled.\" More from the London Film Festival:']\n",

      "Skipping sensational sentence: But she finds herself increasingly identifying with the behaviour of dogs - acting on her feral instincts and being fiercely protective of her offspring\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: The increasingly blurred boundaries between reality and fantasy, and her struggle to separate them, ultimately make her wonder whether she needs more balance in her life\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence:  The film has been described by Entertainment Weekly's Maureen Lee Lenker as \"a playful, creative, and brutally honest portrayal of being a mom\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"This isn’t a movie about how parenting will ruin your life,\" noted Vanity Fair's Hillary Busis, \"but it does tap deeply into how monotonous it can be to care for a small child\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Adams has previously starred in films including Arrival, Nocturnal Animals, American Hustle, Dear Evan Hansen, Vice and The Woman in the Window\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: Heller and Adams walked the red carpet ahead of Nightbitch's UK premiere at London's Royal Festival Hall on Wednesday\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: In an interview with Vanity Fair, Adams said she thought Yoder's novel was \"unique and otherworldly, and like nothing I'd ever read before\", adding: \"The thing I really attached to is this idea of loss of identity.\" Reflecting on her character's journey in the film, Adams explained: \"Through her parenting - through her mothering - she got in touch with something bigger and something primal.\" The 98-minute film has received broadly positive reviews, although some critics suggested not every idea explored in the film fulfils its potential\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence:  \"Part of the brilliance of Nightbitch,\" Lenker said in her review, \"is the ways it doesn't stop at showcasing the isolation and loneliness of motherhood, cut off from a previous version of oneself and one's life\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: It takes this fable a step further.\" She described Heller and Adams as \"a dynamic pair, finding ways to punctuate their bizarre tale with brutal honesty, off-the-wall humour, and a desire to celebrate the messiness and magic of motherhood\"\n",
      "Skipping sensational sentence: \"Loving your child but hating motherhood is a conflict that Heller captures with an honesty that we often don’t see,\" noted Pajiba's Sara Clements\n"

      "Sentences: [\"A water company repeatedly dumped millions of litres of raw sewage illegally into one of England's most famous lakes over a three-year period, the BBC can reveal\", 'More than 140 million litres of waste were pumped into Windermere between 2021 and 2023 at times when it was not permitted, our analysis shows, and United Utilities failed to report most of it', \"It means the company's illegal dumping of sewage into the lake went on for far longer, and was far more extensive, than was previously known\", 'United Utilities said some of its sewage releases into Windermere were \"potentially non-compliant\" but that it self-reports \"over 94% of potential pollution incidents to the Environment Agency\"', \"Matt Staniek, a campaigner against sewage pollution and founder of Save Windermere, said Windermere was “the jewel in the crown of the Lake District National Park, and it's being used as an open sewer”\", 'It is sometimes necessary to release sewage into rivers and lakes to stop the wastewater system from being overwhelmed by heavy rain, but this pollution can damage the environment, causing harmful algal blooms and even killing fish', 'In January this year - after BBC Panorama revealed the company had downplayed the severity of dozens of pollution incidents, some involving Windermere - United Utilities retrospectively reported some discharges into the lake from October 2023 onwards', 'But since then the BBC has obtained United Utilities operations data going back to January 2021 which shows that illegal discharges had been taking place for more than three years, far longer than the discharges in the four months the company retrospectively reported', 'The data involved Glebe Road pumping station in Bowness-on-Windermere, the only site which discharges directly into the lake, which is designed to pump wastewater from the local area to the nearby sewage works for treatment', 'It is authorised by the Environment Agency to release raw sewage into the lake in certain circumstances during wet weather, as long as it is pumping at least 245 litres of sewage a second to the treatment works', 'That condition, written in the site’s environmental permit, is supposed to protect Windermere and ensure that, even in wet weather, most sewage is sent for treatment', 'Failing to comply with the permit is a criminal offence', 'The BBC analysed data detailing the flow of sewage through the station and the times when waste had been dumped into the lake', 'We found the station had failed to comply with the permit by discharging sewage into the lake at times when it had not been pumping the required amount for treatment', 'As a result, sewage which should have been sent for treatment was dumped into the lake', 'Permit breaches should be reported to the Environment Agency, but United Utilities failed to do this for most of the discharges identified by the BBC between the start of 2021 and the end of 2023', 'In those three years, we found that United Utilities illegally pumped sewage into Windermere for 165 hours, of which at least 118 hours was not reported to the environmental regulator', 'We were able to calculate the volume of the sewage released because it was dumped into the lake using either one or two dedicated pumps, each of which operates at 240 litres per second', 'This means that between 143 million and 286 million litres was illegally dumped in the lake, depending how often both pumps were operating', 'United Utilities failed to report at least 102 million litres of that pollution', 'The water company declined to provide the BBC with the data showing exactly when each of the pumps into the lake was operating, claiming this data is classed as \"internal communications\", which did not have to be disclosed under environmental information regulations', \"Mr Staniek, the anti-sewage campaigner, said the failure to report the illegal dumping was “totally and utterly outrageous”, adding that: “Windermere is so culturally significant to the entire nation this isn't just about a local issue.” He said: “Part of the permit is to ensure that they are complying and that they’re analysing the data so they’re either incompetent or they knew about this and they profited from it and it’s Windermere that suffered\", 'And I think it’s the latter', 'United Utilities insiders told the BBC the company would have known that it was illegally discharging sewage because alarms and internal reports alert staff when treatment works or pumping stations are failing to comply with their discharge permits', '\"We would have been aware of the issue – it would have flagged up on flow and spill reports', 'I’m not surprised we haven’t reported it,\" one said', ' \"We work on a risk management basis and we’ll have judged the risk of the EA finding out and understanding the permit breach would be minimal as they are under-resourced and incompetent.\" United Utilities told us it is committed “to being fully transparent” with the Environment Agency', 'A spokesperson said as part of ongoing work to reduce spills in 2024 the company discovered a \"technical issue in the configuration of the Windermere system\" which meant that some of the discharges from the Glebe Road pumping station were \"potentially non-compliant\"', 'The company has \"implemented system changes to prevent a reoccurrence\", the spokesperson said', 'United Utilities also said it is starting construction on additional storage and treatment facilities around Windermere, to reduce sewage discharges', 'Water companies are judged on the number of pollution incidents they cause each year by the water industry regulator Ofwat and financially rewarded or penalised on their performance', 'Environment Agency guidance about calculating the number of illegal discharges during repeated incidents is not clear', 'So the BBC has treated all illegal discharges within 24 hours of each other as just one “minor” incident, with subsequent incidents only being recorded after a 24-hour period with no illegal dumping', 'Using this method, we calculated that illegal discharges we identified could account for 24 extra pollution incidents', 'That would mean if the incidents identified by the BBC had been officially reported, it would have cost the company just over £2.5m', 'United Utilities told the BBC that any potentially non-compliant discharges were reported to the Environment Agency \"as soon as we became aware of them\"', 'Therefore, the company said, it did not benefit from any unjust rewards from Ofwat', 'United Utilities only finally reported most of the other discharges earlier this month, after being approached by the BBC and following a request from the Environment Agency', 'The company did not answer the BBC’s questions about why it had failed to identify and report those discharges at the time they occurred', 'Ofwat told the BBC: \"The allegations made against United Utilities in terms of environmental failures and under-reporting of pollution incidents are very serious and where evidence supports further action, we will not hesitate to use all the powers at our disposal.\" The water regulator told the BBC if a water company is found in breach of its obligations, any unjust rewards can be clawed back later through lower bills', 'It is not the first time that United Utilities’ pumping station on the edge of Windermere has come under scrutiny', 'Earlier this year BBC News reported millions of litres being illegally discharged in one night due to a communications fault and last year BBC Panorama revealed how both United Utilities and the Environment Agency had been downgrading significant pollution incidents to \"no impact\"', 'The Environment Agency said in a statement it had launched a \"complex and ongoing\" investigation into the sewage discharges from October 2023 onwards that were retrospectively reported by United Utilities, and it was examining further evidence received from the company', '\"If any water company is found to be in breach of an environmental permit, the Environment Agency will take the appropriate enforcement action, up to and including a criminal prosecution,\" the agency said', 'However, the BBC has learned that in the first eight months of the investigation the agency failed to obtain the crucial operational data needed to uncover illegal pollution in 2023 - data which was obtained and analysed by the BBC', 'The Environment Agency has now confirmed it has this data', 'Told about the BBC’s analysis showing that the illegal pollution appears to have occurred for more than two years before the period being investigated, the agency said it will now review the evidence and scope of the criminal investigation', 'During the election campaign, the now Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he was \"furious and sickened\" to hear the BBC’s earlier revelations about sewage pumped illegally into Windermere and promised \"severe and automatic fines that no water companies can ignore\"', 'Environment Secretary Steve Reed said it was \"disgusting that somewhere as beautiful as Lake Windermere is swilling with raw sewage\" but said the government is already taking action, introducing legislation to ban polluting bosses from receiving bonuses or even send them to prison', 'United Utilities was recently given permission by Ofwat to raise bills to claim an extra £33.2m in profit as a reward for its 2023 performance, while the Environment Agency awarded the company the top 4* environmental rating earlier this year.']\n",

only snippets of it are available online', ' Woman of the Hour opens in 1977 with Alcala encouraging a woman named Sarah to reveal details of her personal life as he photographs her in a remote mountain region of Wyoming', ' Things take a sinister turn when Alcala suddenly turns nasty and begins to attack her, setting the tone for the way he preys on several of the women he encounters for the rest of the film', \" The film's timeline jumps around, as the viewer follows a few different strands which each focus on a different woman\", 'The murders themselves are not shown on screen', \"Instead, the film focuses on Alcala's initial encounters with the women and the moments leading up to the killings\", 'A sizeable portion of the movie is taken up with the day the episode of The Dating Game was filmed', 'As well as directing the film, Kendrick plays Bradshaw - the woman who appeared on the dating show alongside Alcala', 'Although based on real-life cases, the film takes some artistic licence', \"For instance, Bradshaw is seen going against the dating show presenter's wishes by going off-script and asking the bachelors her own questions, giving the film a more feminist angle than was the case in reality\", ' The date between Bradshaw and Alcala is also an invention', 'In reality, they never made it as far as a date, but the film imagines their trip to a bar and a subsequent altercation in the car park', \"One of Alcala's victims, Monique Hoyt, was able to escape after being attacked -

now the cancer has spread to her liver', '\"I\\'m going to die,” the 53-year-old says', '“It\\'s not going to end well and it\\'s not going to be pretty.\" But she hopes to stay alive until her children, both in their early 20s, leave home', 'Jeannie is one of about 1,000 people who can’t access a treatment that could extend their lives because it has not been approved for funding on the NHS in England, Wales and Northern Ireland', 'The drug, called Enhertu, can give patients with a specific type of incurable breast cancer an extra six months to live on average', 'The health assessment body, NICE, is the only organisation around the world so far to say no to the drug for this condition', 'It says that it is too expensive for the NHS to fund', 'The decision applies in England - but Wales and Northern Ireland will follow this guidance too', \"Drug companies and charities have criticised NICE's decision\", 'Claire Rowney, chief executive of charity Breast Cancer Now, says it is \"deeply unjust that patients are currently caught in a stand-off between NICE and the pharmaceutical companies”', 'Jeannie echoes these thoughts', '“I want to stay alive, I want to keep living,” she says', '\"I\\'m really, really annoyed and upset that NICE doesn\\'t think my life is important enough to extend.\" She says Enhertu would give her extra time with her family - and possibly keep her alive until another new treatment comes along', 'When Enhertu - the first licensed treatment for HER2-low metastatic breast cancer - was launched at a cancer conference in summer 2022, health professionals gave it a standing ovation', 'It gives people more time before their cancer gets worse', 'The drug companies that make it, AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo, say some patients are still alive after three years', \"There's no dispute over how effective it is - the row is about whether or not the NHS should pay for it\", \"In July, NICE decided not to recommend it, saying it wouldn't be good value for taxpayers and calling on AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo to offer a better price\", 'Health Secretary Wes Streeting also points to the cost', '“I am incredibly disappointed that the manufacturers of Enhertu were unwilling to sell this life-extending drug to the NHS at a fair and reasonable price, despite the best efforts of NICE and NHS England,\" he says', \"However Dr Greg Rossi, AstraZeneca's head of oncology for Europe and Canada, believes the company is asking a fair price\", 'He points to deals with 19 countries in Europe, and another 10 worldwide, including the US, Australia and Canada', 'Dr Rossi says the decision by NICE is “absolutely a single outlier”', '\"Every other market we\\'ve been talking to has either made an agreement, or we\\'re in discussions at the moment.\" Drug price negotiations are confidential, so he won’t be drawn on numbers, beyond saying that the impact on the medicines budget would be “relatively affordable”', 'Dr Rossi says NICE changed how it assessed severe diseases in 2022, introducing a new system, known as a severity modifier, because it felt that decisions under the previous method disproportionately favoured cancer', \"For this group of patients, Enhertu got a “medium” severity rating, which wasn't enough to tip the scales in their favour\", 'Dr Rossi is adamant that under the old system, patients would be getting the drug on the NHS', 'He pinpoints one issue: the new approach had to be \"opportunity cost neutral\" - in other words, including a wider range of diseases without extra NHS spending', 'He is concerned the severity modifier could make it harder to launch future cancer drugs', 'He says the only way to fix this is for the Department of Health and Social Care to allow more flexibility', 'Another cancer drug for incurable blood cancer myeloma has been rejected too', 'Shelagh McKinlay, from the charity Myeloma UK, says the bar to get treatments approved “has been raised impossibly high”', '“We simply should not be here,” she says', '“It’s hugely unfair for someone who could live less than 24 months without treatment to be denied the very thing that could give them more time with their loved ones because of a change to the system.” But Helen Knight, NICE’s director of medicines evaluation, argues that the severity modifier is working', 'She says it has meant treatments for conditions like cystic fibrosis and hepatitis B are getting NHS funding', 'She accepts that the Enhertu decision is “incredibly devastating” for patients and their families', 'But she is confident that it was the right decision', 'She says: “NICE has to look at the NHS as a whole, and understand that it has a finite budget', \"It doesn't get any more money when we say yes to a treatment\", 'So if we recommend treatments, then other patients are impacted.” Jeannie put us in touch with a group of about 20 women who are all in the same position as her', 'They range from their early 30s to mid 50s and all have advanced HER2-low breast cancer', \"They're all very keen to stress that they're not slowly fading away, but are living full and busy lives\", 'They sent snapshots of their lives, showing them dancing with their kids, or on nights out with their friends', \"Some are surfers, and there's a few cold-water swimmers and a sky diver\", 'They have limited options to get Enhertu -

      "Sentences: ['Hong KongCNN—Ananticipated meetingbetween Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen and US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California this week has sparked concerns of a repeat of the pressure campaignChinalaunched last year when then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei.At that time, Beijingencircled the island democracywith unprecedented military drills – firing multiple missiles into its surrounding waters and sending dozens of warplanes speeding across a sensitive median line dividing the Taiwan Strait.It alsocut off contactwith the United States over a number of issues from military matters to combating climate change, in retaliation for what it viewed as a violation of its sovereignty.Ad FeedbackThis time, Beijing has already threatened to “resolutely fight back” if a Tsai-McCarthy meeting goes ahead.PlayVideo Ad FeedbackSee why tensions are rising between US and China over Taiwan02:32- Source:CNNIt also slammed Washington for allowing Tsai to stopover in the US while en route to and from official visits in Central America, warning it could lead to“serious” confrontationbetween the two powers.Adefiant Tsaistaked out her own ground, pledging as she took off on her 10-day trip not to let “external pressure” stop Taiwan from connecting with the world and like-minded democracies.Ad FeedbackBut the optics of the meeting, taking place in California and not Taiwan, and its timing – at a particularly thorny moment in China’s foreign relations andahead of a presidential election in Taiwan that could reset the tone of its relationship with Beijing – may see Beijing tread more carefully this time, or at least not escalate further, analysts say.“This puts the burden on China not to overreact, because any overreaction is only going to push China further away from the world,” said Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington.That doesn’t mean, however, that Beijing won’t be closely watching Tsai’s movements as it calibrates its response – and decides how much military might to flex over her meeting with an American lawmaker on American soil.The opacity of China’s system – and the potential for competing interests within its vast bureaucracy – also make it difficult to accurately predict its response.“Every time Taiwan does anything that China doesn’t like, the Chinese react with their own military coercion,” Sun said', 'But in the current situation, “they have to consider the consequences of overreaction,” she added.House Speaker Kevin McCarthy talks to reporters at the Capitol in Washington on March 24, 2023.J', 'Scott Applewhite/APRising pressureThe expected meeting, which McCarthy’s officeannouncedearlier this week would take place on Wednesday, also comes at a precarious moment in US-China relations.Washington and Beijing are struggling to stabilize their communicationamid flaring tensions over issues from a downedsuspected Chinese surveillance balloontosemiconductor supply chains– raising the stakes of potential damage to that relationship if Beijing lashes out as it did when Tsai met Pelosi.Taiwan is still feeling the fallout of that response last August, with Chinese military forces now regularly making incursions over what had previously been an informal but largely respected border of control between Beijing and Taipei in the Taiwan Strait', 'Taiwan’s official Central News Agency also reported Monday that Tsai would meet with McCarthy, citing Tsai’s presidential office.PlayVideo Ad FeedbackSee image of a Chinese balloon hovering over Taiwan03:05- Source:CNNBut a meeting between Tsai and the leader of the Republican majority in the US House of Representatives, who ranks second in line to the Presidency, would mark another symbolic moment for Taiwan and the US, which only maintain unofficial ties.For Tsai, who is entering the final year of her two-term presidency, “it’s clearly a capstone event,” according to Wen-Ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University’s Taiwan Studies Program', '“She has this image as the Taiwanese president who has taken US-Taiwan relations to new heights, and who … has been able to give Taiwan almost unprecedented international visibility,” he said.That increased visibility – and enhanced cooperation with the US – has followed China’s mounting pressure on the island, which sits fewer than 110 miles (177 kilometers) from the mainland coast.China’s Communist Party claims the self-governing island democracy as its own despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island, by force if necessary.The flags of Taiwan and Honduras flutter in the wind outside the Taiwan Embassy in Tegucigalpa, Honduras March 15, 2023', \"REUTERS/Fredy RodriguezFredy Rodriguez/Reuters/FILEChina thinks it's diplomatically isolating Taiwan\", \"It isn'tThe party has undertaken a sweeping expansion of its military capabilities over the past decade under leader Xi Jinping – and ramped up its pervasive economic, diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan.That’s driven concerns, among some in Washington, that Beijing is preparing for an invasion, though China’s official language still suggests that scenario is not its preferred option for achieving the claimed goal of “reunification.”It is those pressures – and how to support Taiwan against unilateral actions by Beijing – that are likely to be on the table when Tsai, McCarthy and a bipartisan group of US lawmakers sit down on Wednesday.Congress has been a pillar of increasing American support for Taiwan in recent years\", \"Lawmakers regularly visit the island and drive bipartisan legislation enhancing support and cooperation.While the US switched its diplomatic relations to Beijing decades ago, it maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and is bound by law to provide the democratic island with the means to defend itself.Under Washington’s longstanding “One China” policy, the US acknowledges China’s position that Taiwan is part of China, but has never officially recognized Beijing’s claim to the island of 23 million.Though McCarthy does not have Pelosi’s decades-long record of advocacy regarding China, the California Republican is now a leading voice pushing for closer scrutiny of Beijing, and meeting Tsai could help him to burnish that image.Last month, McCarthy told reporters that meeting Tsai in the US would not impact whether he travels to Taiwan in the future – something he had earlier said he wanted to do.Fighter jets of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Eastern Theater Command conduct joint combat training exercises around Taiwan on August 7, 2022 in this photo released by Xinhua News Agency.Gong Yulong/Xinhua/APBeijing watchingA meeting in California, on US soil, is widely seen as less likely to provoke Beijing than a McCarthy visit to Taiwan.Pelosi’s trip – the first from a lawmaker of that rank to the island in 25 years – generated afever pitch of nationalist and anti-US rhetoricin mainland China.This time, so far, domestic conversation in China’s heavily controlled media sphere has been significantly muted.But the stakes remain high – including for Beijing itself – over how it responds, analysts say.As Taiwan prepares for a presidential election in January, a fierce response could push voters away from Taiwan’s main opposition party Kuomintang (KMT), widely seen as more friendly toward Beijing.It could also jar with another high profile trip happening now: a tour of mainland China from former Taiwan president and senior KMT memberMa Ying-jeou, the first visit from a current or former Taiwan leader since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949.Ma’s tour is a “once in a half a century opportunity to send a conciliatory message between the two sides, Beijing shouldn’t want to tank that,” said Sung, the political scientist.A Taiwanese military corvette sails as a Navy soldier stands guard on a vessel,

brighterglobal spotlightfollowing the invasion of Ukraine by Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close diplomatic partner of Xi', \"Putin’s rhetoric over Ukraine has echoes of how Xi speaks of Taiwan.Beijing has recently sought to position itself asan agent of peacein that conflict – especially as it aims to repair frayed ties with Europe.This week, as Tsai is expected to meet with McCarthy, French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will head to China – an important opportunity that Xi may not want to overshadow with military posturing.An aggressive response also risks stoking confrontation with the US, not yet six months after Xi and US President Joe Biden called to enhance communication during aface-to-face meetingin Bali.“(A less overtly aggressive response) would imply that Beijing does not wish to escalate tension with the US to a level that can risk getting out of hand,” said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London.“A reset in US-China ties is not on the agenda, but an easing of tension is not beyond the realm of possibility.”PlayVideo Ad FeedbackBreakdown in US-China relations a
